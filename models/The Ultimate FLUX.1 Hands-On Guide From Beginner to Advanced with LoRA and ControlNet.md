## Introduction

In this article, we will guide you step-by-step on how to use FLUX.1.

The open-source community has welcomed a new text-to-image generation model, FLUX.1, following the releases of SD 3 Medium and Kolors. Developed by former core members of Stability AI, FLUX.1 significantly surpasses the quality of SD 3 and even rivals the closed-source Midjourney v6.1 model. This positions FLUX.1 as a new benchmark in AI-generated art and injects fresh momentum into the development of open-source AI art.

The company behind FLUX.1 is Black Forest Labs, founded by the original team behind Stable Diffusion and several former researchers from Stability AI. Like Stability AI, Black Forest Labs is dedicated to developing high-quality multimodal models and making them open-source. The company has already completed a $31 million seed funding round.

Black Forest Labs website: [https://blackforestlabs.ai/](https://blackforestlabs.ai/)

FLUX.1 offers three versions: Pro, Dev, and Schnell. The first two models outperform mainstream models like SD3-Ultra, while the smaller FLUX.1 [schnell] surpasses larger models such as Midjourney v6.0 and DALL·E 3.

FLUX.1 excels in text generation, following complex instructions, and rendering human hands. Below are examples of images generated by its most powerful model, FLUX.1 [pro]. As you can see, even when generating large blocks of text or multiple characters, there are no errors in details such as text or human hands.

1. If you have 16GB or more of VRAM, the official models are undoubtedly the best choice, offering the best performance and image quality.
2. Next are the FP8 models, which are significantly smaller than the original models and can run on 8GB VRAM, with no noticeable decline in critical text and detail generation quality.
3. Then there are the NF4 quantized versions released by @lllyasviel. These models are even smaller and faster to generate images. They can run on 6GB VRAM when using the shared mode in WebUI forge. There are two versions, v1 and v2, with v2 offering better detail and speed.
4. Finally, there are three GGUF quantized versions developed by @City96. The Q8 version offers better image output and speed than FP8, requiring more than 12GB of VRAM; the Q4 version can run on 8GB VRAM and provides slightly better generation quality than NF4.
5. Note: The usage licenses for these quantized versions are consistent with the original models, i.e., Dev is not for commercial use, while Schnell is for commercial use.

> What does “fp” mean?
>
> Quantization is a technique used to reduce the size and computational requirements of machine learning models, particularly large language models. By converting high-precision parameters (like 32-bit floating-point numbers) into lower precision formats (such as 8-bit integers), quantization helps to **decrease memory usage and accelerate inference without significantly compromising model accuracy**. This process is crucial for deploying large models on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones or edge devices, enabling faster and more efficient performance. Quantization is often employed in various stages, including post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, to achieve an optimal balance between model efficiency and accuracy.
>
> What is UNet model？
>
> The UNet model is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) designed primarily for image segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image. It features a symmetric encoder-decoder structure: the encoder captures contextual information by progressively downsampling the input image, while the decoder reconstructs the image with precise pixel-level details through upsampling. The model's key innovation is the use of skip connections that link corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder, enabling it to retain and combine both high-level and low-level features, which is crucial for accurate segmentation and other pixel-wise prediction tasks.

> What is CLIP?
>
> ComfyUI Clip is an open-source pre-trained large model based on M6 by Alibaba, focusing on natural language processing tasks such as text understanding, code analysis, and generation. In this context, "semantic segmentation" typically refers to the model's ability to understand and identify the meaning of different parts of the input text, such as parsing document structures or identifying elements like functions and variable names in code blocks. ComfyUI Clip leverages deep learning technology to efficiently extract key information from texts, supporting customized tasks across various application scenarios.
>
> CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is a pre-trained vision-language model released by OpenAI in 2021. This model learns from a vast amount of internet images and text pairs through unsupervised learning, enabling it to understand image content and associate it with natural language descriptions even without domain-specific labeled data. The core idea of the CLIP model is to map images and texts into a shared high-dimensional vector space, so that similar text descriptions and corresponding images are closer in this space.
>
> In semantic segmentation tasks, CLIP can serve as a feature extractor, generating a contextually relevant semantic map for input images based on text descriptions. This capability is useful in fields such as image understanding and autonomous driving. Users can leverage its cross-modal abilities to guide segmentation tasks; for example, by inputting a text about "cats" and then guiding how to distinguish a cat's face from other parts.
>
> What is T5XXL?
>
> T5XXL is the largest variant of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model, designed by Google for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. With billions of parameters, T5XXL excels in tasks such as translation, summarization, question-answering, text generation, and even code completion by framing all tasks as text-to-text problems. Its massive size allows it to capture complex patterns and nuances in language, making it one of the most powerful models in the T5 family. Despite its resource-intensive nature, T5XXL is widely used in research and industry for applications that demand high accuracy and sophisticated language understanding, particularly in areas where nuanced language comprehension is crucial.

> What is VAE model?
>
> A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of deep learning model used to generate new data similar to a given dataset. It works by compressing input data into a lower-dimensional latent space represented as a probability distribution, then reconstructing the original data by sampling from this distribution. This allows the VAE to create diverse outputs, making it useful for tasks like image generation, data imputation, and anomaly detection. By learning the underlying distribution of the data, VAEs can generate new, similar data points in a structured and probabilistic manner.

Once the workflow is loaded, it looks like the image below:

Please note that the configuration in the workflow template might differ from your actual setup. Carefully check and edit the model selection information in the `Load Diffusion Model`, `DualCLIPLoader`, and `Load VAE` sections on the left side of the image below to ensure you are using the versions you just downloaded.

Enter your prompt in the green box on the right side and click `Queue Prompt` on the floating toolbar to start generating images. If there are any errors, check the configuration of the nodes that turn red to ensure they are correct.

At this point, you can use various versions of the FLUX models to generate images. An example of an image generated using the FLUX Schnell FP8 model is shown below:

## LoRA (Advanced Usage)

Here is a website where you can experience the FLUX.1 LoRA model online:

[https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/flux-lora-the-explorer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/flux-lora-the-explorer)

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is used in text-to-image generation to fine-tune large pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion with much less computational cost. By modifying only a small, low-rank subset of the model's parameters, LoRA enables the model to adapt to specific styles, subjects, or domains based on the provided text prompts without needing to retrain the entire model.

Suppose you have a pre-trained text-to-image model, and you want it to generate images in a specific artistic style, like "Van Gogh-like landscapes." Instead of retraining the whole model, which would be resource-intensive, you use LoRA to fine-tune the model on a smaller dataset of Van Gogh-style images paired with relevant text descriptions. This allows the model to learn the nuances of that style and apply it to new text prompts, generating images with the desired artistic characteristics.

### Download the LoRA Model

FLUX.1 LoRA and other resources, you can download on:

- [https://civitai.com/models](https://civitai.com/models)
- [https://www.liblib.art/](https://www.liblib.art/)

Here, we choose the LoRA created by the XLabs-AI team:

[https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-lora-collection/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-lora-collection/tree/main)

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202408232118240.png)

Currently, XLabs has released 7 LoRA models for FLUX.1, including Anime, Art, Disney, MJV6, Plush, Realistic, and Scenery. Download the required LoRA model files with `comfy_converted` and place them in the `ComfyUI\models\loras` directory.

> For LoRA models without `comfy_converted`, you need to install the `x-flux-comfyui` plugin and place them in the `ComfyUI/models/xlabs/loras` directory to use them.
> 

### LoRA Workflow

When using FLUX.1 LoRA in ComfyUI, there are also 2 different workflows available: one is based on the native workflow, where the main model is stored in the Unet folder; the other is a simplified workflow suitable for the fp8 model released by ComfyUI, where the main model is placed in the checkpoints folder.

**Native Workflow:**

This workflow requires the use of [https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts).

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts.git` to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory. The script will then automatically install all custom scripts and nodes. It will attempt to use symlinks and junctions to avoid having to copy files and keep them up to date.

After cloning, restart ComfyUI for the changes to take effect.

## ControlNet (Advanced Usage)

ControlNet is used to give users more precise control over the image generation process, particularly when using models like Stable Diffusion. For example, if a user wants to generate an image based on a text prompt but also wants to ensure that the generated image follows a specific structure or outline (like a particular pose or shape), ControlNet allows the integration of that structure into the model’s decision-making process. This makes it possible to create images that not only match the text description but also adhere to specific visual constraints, such as the silhouette of a character or the layout of a scene.

### Download ControlNet Model

Currently, there are two teams in the open-source community that have trained ControlNet models suitable for FLUX.1. These models are compatible with both the official FLUX.1 and fp8 models. They also have higher VRAM requirements, needing 12GB or more to generate smoothly.

**FLUX.1 ControlNet Collections:**

**InstanX FLUX.1 Controlnet Union :**

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202408232121030.png)

Here, we use the ControlNet developed by XLabs as an example. First, you need to install the dependencies:

1. Go to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/XLabs-AI/x-flux-comfyui.git`
3. Go to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/x-flux-comfyui/` and run `python setup.py`
4. Restart ComfyUI

After the first launch, the `ComfyUI/models/xlabs/loras` and `ComfyUI/models/xlabs/controlnets` folders will be created automatically.

So, to use LoRA or ControlNet, just put the models in these folders.

Next, we need to install [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager). Similarly, go to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` and run `git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git`, then restart ComfyUI.

Click "Manager" button on main menu

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202408232123263.png)

If you click on 'Install Custom Nodes' or 'Install Models', an installer dialog will open.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202408232124407.png)

Click on the first `Custom Nodes Manager` in the middle column, search for "ControlNet" and you will see the [`comfyui_controlnet_aux`](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux) project by the author Fannovel16. Click to install it. After the installation is complete, click restart. The dependency installation will run in the background, and once completed, ComfyUI will open a new browser tab.
