AutoTM - Advancing Topic Modeling with AI-Powered Optimization

The paper presents AutoTM 2.0, an advanced framework designed for optimizing additively regularized topic models (ARTM). It aims to simplify the complex process of topic modeling, making it accessible for both specialists and non-specialists. By integrating novel optimization pipelines and large language model (LLM)-based quality metrics, AutoTM 2.0 offers enhanced performance for analyzing and clustering text documents across diverse datasets. This version addresses the challenge of flexibility and parameter tuning in topic models, providing an adaptable solution for varied corpora.

1. **Context/Problem Statement:**  
   Topic modeling involves creating models that uncover the underlying structure of large text corpora. While effective, additively regularized topic models (ARTM) demand a high level of expertise to configure their parameters, making them challenging for general users. The need for an accessible yet powerful tool that simplifies this process is crucial for researchers and practitioners.

2. **Methodology**  
   AutoTM 2.0 introduces a dynamic vector-based optimization pipeline, improving over the previous fixed-size approach. It integrates LLM-based evaluation metrics to better align model performance with human judgment. These innovations make the framework more flexible and user-friendly, reducing the need for expertise while offering robust performance. Its distributed mode further enables efficient handling of large datasets, allowing users to scale up their text analysis efforts seamlessly.

3. **Key Findings:**  
   - AutoTM 2.0 demonstrated an average performance improvement of 13.0% over the original version.
   - The LLM-based metrics showed a high correlation with human evaluations, especially in complex datasets.
   - The framework's surrogate modeling capability decreased computational time by approximately 10% while maintaining high model quality.

4. **Conclusion & Future Challenges:**  
   AutoTM 2.0 offers a substantial step forward in topic modeling by making advanced ARTM more accessible and efficient. However, future challenges include refining the LLM-based metrics for broader applicability and enhancing support for languages beyond English and Russian. Further research could focus on integrating newer AI models to improve both the interpretability and accuracy of topic models.
