## 1️⃣ Problem Statement
Rice is a critical food staple for millions worldwide, particularly in low-income regions. Diseases affecting rice leaves can significantly reduce yields, threatening food security. Traditional methods of disease identification, such as visual inspection, are often slow and prone to error. This study aims to automate this process using advanced AI methods, offering a reliable solution for timely disease detection.

## 2️⃣ Methodology
The paper proposes a novel application of CNNs using transfer learning to classify rice leaf diseases, integrating models like ResNet-50, DenseNet121, VGG16, and MobileNetV2. The study stands out by not only achieving high accuracy in disease detection but also by providing a user-friendly interface through a Tkinter-based application, which allows farmers to utilize the technology with minimal technical expertise.

## 3️⃣ Key Findings
The study found that the MobileNetV2 model achieved the highest accuracy of 95.83% in disease classification, followed closely by DenseNet121 at 91.61%. The integration of these models into the Tkinter application enables real-time disease detection, allowing farmers to quickly identify issues and receive tailored recommendations for managing rice crops.

## 4️⃣ Conclusion
This research highlights the potential of AI in transforming agricultural practices, particularly in developing countries. Future work includes addressing limitations like the small dataset size and improving the scalability of the solution for mobile devices. Expanding the dataset and refining the models could lead to even greater accuracy and broader applicability in real-world farming environments.
