ðŸ”¹ Traditional freeform optics design relies on manual, iterative processes, which are time-consuming and often fail to explore the full design space. AI offers a solution by automating complex tasks, making it possible to handle larger design spaces and improve performance. The growing demand for advanced optical systems across industries further emphasizes the need for AI-driven design approaches.

ðŸ”¹ The paper introduces AI techniques like machine learning and deep learning, which automate design generation, performance optimization, and system behavior prediction. These methods surpass traditional approaches by exploring non-intuitive solutions and improving accuracy. The use of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), significantly enhances design efficiency while reducing computational load.

ðŸ”¹AI-based design strategies have shown great success in both imaging and non-imaging systems. Case studies demonstrate improvements in wavefront error, image quality, and energy distribution. AI-driven metasurface designs have also enabled novel optical applications like ultra-thin lenses. These advancements highlight AI's potential to push the boundaries of freeform optics design.

ðŸ”¹ While AI presents exciting possibilities, challenges like data requirements, model interpretability, and computational costs remain. The paper suggests future research directions such as hybrid design approaches and explainable AI to address these issues. AI-driven manufacturing techniques also hold potential for further innovations in freeform optics. Overall, AI is poised to transform the field, driving significant advancements
