Link to Article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02650v1

üìç This research presents a comprehensive survey on the issue of memorization in large language models (LLMs) and its implications for privacy and security. While LLMs have revolutionized natural language processing, they inadvertently store and reproduce phrases from their training data, posing significant risks.

üî∏ Challenges in Memorization: Memorization can result in unintended leakage of sensitive information, exposing personal details, copyrighted materials, or confidential data. This can lead to both privacy breaches and intellectual property concerns. The issue becomes critical as LLMs, designed to generalize information, sometimes retrieve verbatim text from their datasets.

üî∏ Capabilities of LLM Memorization Detection: The paper categorizes memorization into several dimensions‚Äîsuch as intentionality, retrievability, and transparency‚Äîproviding a detailed exploration of how these models retain and recall information. By leveraging metrics like the exposure metric and inference attacks, the study evaluates the extent of memorization across different LLM architectures.

üî∏ Performance and Flexibility: The study highlights the ability of LLMs to retain both factual and conceptual information, enhancing performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, it stresses the need to develop new methodologies that balance performance improvements with the mitigation of privacy risks.

üî∏ Impact and Future Directions: To safeguard user privacy, the research emphasizes mitigating memorization through techniques such as differential privacy, MemFree decoding, and data de-duplication. These strategies aim to reduce the likelihood of information leakage without significantly degrading the utility of the LLMs.

üî∏ Contribution to AI Ethics and Governance: By addressing the risks associated with memorization in LLMs, this research contributes significantly to the broader discussion around AI governance, privacy, and ethics. It provides a framework for future research on balancing performance, privacy, and ethical considerations in AI development.
