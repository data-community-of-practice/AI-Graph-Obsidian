Bridges are more than just functional structures; they are integral to a landscape's visual appeal. Achieving a balance between structural mechanics and aesthetic form is challenging. This paper introduces how fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, a powerful AI model, can be applied to generate innovative bridge designs that reflect specific aesthetic styles while exploring new structural possibilities.

Novelty: The key contribution of this work lies in fine-tuning Stable Diffusion using four different methods: Textual Inversion, Dreambooth, Hypernetwork, and Lora. These techniques allow the AI to not only generate basic bridge shapes but also inject a creative spark into the design process, proposing new bridge types that might have been beyond human designers' immediate thinking. By working with a small dataset of real-world bridge photos, Stable Diffusion learns to capture the essence of a design and produce a variety of new models with similar styles but different structures.

Key Findings:
1) Innovative Bridge Designs: Stable Diffusion, when fine-tuned, generated thousands of bridge designs with similar aesthetics to real-world examples like the Coral Bridge in Qingdao, China, while presenting new geometric variations.
2) Enhanced Creativity: By leveraging the fine-tuned model, the AI was able to offer designers numerous creative options in a fraction of the time compared to traditional methods.
3) Efficiency: With only a small amount of training data, the fine-tuning process enabled highly efficient learning, reducing time and resources typically required for creative design.

This study demonstrates that AI can serve as both a creative assistant and a powerful tool in architectural design. By fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, bridge designers can explore new possibilities that blend aesthetics and structural innovation, ultimately speeding up the creative process while maintaining high-quality results.
