Enhancing AI Explainability with Ontology-Driven Multimodal Models

**Article link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18753

ðŸ“ŒMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing AI's ability to interpret complex data, integrating vision and language. However, in domain-specific tasks like plant disease classification, these models struggle with explainability and accuracy. This paper proposes using ontologies to address these issues, enhancing both the performance and transparency of MLLMs.

ðŸ”¹MLLMs have transformed various tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning, but their ability to handle specialized domains, like agriculture, is limited. These models often lack the domain-specific knowledge required to interpret complex visual data. To bridge this gap, the paper introduces a framework that combines MLLMs with an ontology-based system to improve plant disease classification.

ðŸ”¹The framework leverages existing knowledge from a plant disease ontology to guide the MLLM in identifying disease-specific visual concepts. This method enhances the modelâ€™s ability to align its outputs with domain-specific knowledge, making it more accurate and reliable. Additionally, using ontology reasoning enables the model to offer more transparent and explainable classification results.

ðŸ”¹Key findings show that incorporating an ontology significantly improves the modelâ€™s ability to identify fine-grained concepts like leaf color and symptom shapes, essential for accurate plant disease diagnosis. This ontology-driven approach not only boosts the MLLMâ€™s accuracy but also mitigates the problem of hallucinations, where the model generates incorrect outputs.

ðŸ”¹This innovative approach demonstrates the potential for combining ontologies with MLLMs to improve AI explainability and trust in specialized fields. While the focus is on plant disease classification, the framework is adaptable to other domains, such as healthcare, where explainability and accuracy are critical. Future developments could explore integrating multiple ontologies to enhance model performance further.
