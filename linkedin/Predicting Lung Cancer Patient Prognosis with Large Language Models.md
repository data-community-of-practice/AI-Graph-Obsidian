From ChatGPT to Cancer Prognosis: LLMs Tackle Lung Cancer Prediction

ðŸ“Œ Predicting prognosis for lung cancer patients is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies, but traditional methods often rely heavily on retrospective patient data. This paper explores a novel approach using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o mini and GPT-3.5 to predict survival rates and post-operative complications for lung cancer patients. By leveraging the vast knowledge embedded in these models, the researchers demonstrate that LLMs can achieve competitive and sometimes superior performance compared to traditional data-driven methods, potentially revolutionizing clinical outcome prediction in scenarios where patient data is limited or unavailable.

ðŸ”¹ Current prognosis prediction methods face challenges: they require large datasets, often unavailable in smaller healthcare settings or for rare cancers. These models also lack explanatory power, hindering clinical trust and interpretation. There's a need for flexible, interpretable approaches that perform well with limited data.

ðŸ”¹ This study introduces a novel approach using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o mini and GPT-3.5 for lung cancer prognosis prediction. By leveraging the vast knowledge embedded in these models, the researchers demonstrate that LLMs can predict survival rates and post-operative complications without additional patient data. This method offers potential for prognosis prediction in data-limited scenarios and provides explainable results, addressing key limitations of traditional approaches.

ðŸ”¹ The study's results demonstrate that LLMs, particularly GPT-4o mini, consistently outperformed or matched traditional logistic regression models in predicting lung cancer survival and post-operative complications. For survival prediction, GPT-4o mini achieved the highest average AUROC (0.726) and AUPRC (0.401). In post-operative complication prediction, LLMs showed more robust performance, especially for rare complications where traditional models struggled. Notably, these results were achieved using zero-shot prompts, without additional training on patient data.

ðŸ”¹ This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in clinical outcome prediction, offering a novel paradigm that doesn't rely on extensive retrospective data. However, challenges remain. Future research should explore integrating clinical and imaging data, investigate performance across diverse medical domains, and address potential biases in LLM training data. As LLMs continue to evolve, their role in healthcare decision support may grow, potentially transforming how we approach prognosis prediction and personalized medicine.
