DifuzCam: Enhancing Lensless Imaging with Diffusion Models

ðŸ“Œ This paper presents DifuzCam, a novel approach that replaces traditional camera lenses with a mask and utilizes a diffusion model for image reconstruction. The study focuses on developing a lensless, flat camera design that significantly reduces the size and weight of cameras while improving image quality through advanced computational methods. This paper addresses the challenges of reconstructing high-quality images from flat camera measurements, which is an ill-posed task.

ðŸ”¹ The paper tackles the challenge of reducing camera size and weight by replacing traditional lenses with a mask in a flat, lensless camera design. This approach creates a significant problem in reconstructing high-quality images from the camera's raw sensor measurements, a process that is inherently complex and difficult.

ðŸ”¹ The authors propose DifuzCam, which leverages a pre-trained diffusion model combined with a control network and a learned separable transformation for image reconstruction. This methodology not only enhances image quality but also allows the incorporation of textual descriptions to guide the reconstruction process. This contribution is significant as it offers state-of-the-art results in the field of lensless imaging and opens new possibilities for practical applications.

ðŸ”¹ The DifuzCam method outperforms previous approaches in reconstructing images from flat cameras, achieving superior results in all evaluated metrics. The addition of text guidance further improves the perceptual quality of the reconstructed images, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel approach.

ðŸ”¹ The paper concludes that DifuzCam represents a significant advancement in the field of lensless imaging, offering high-quality reconstructions and a scalable solution for various imaging systems. Future challenges include refining this method for broader applications and exploring other enhancements to improve the robustness and accuracy of image reconstructions in real-world scenarios.
