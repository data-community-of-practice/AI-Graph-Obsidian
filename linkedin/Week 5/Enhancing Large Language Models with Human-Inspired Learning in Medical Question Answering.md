Enhancing Large Language Models with Human-Inspired Learning in Medical Question Answering

**Article link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07888

ðŸ“ŒThe paper explores how human-inspired learning strategies, particularly curriculum learning, can be applied to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for medical question answering. This research highlights the efficiency and potential of these strategies in optimizing model performance.

ðŸ”¹Training LLMs is resource-intensive, driving the need for data-efficient methods. While curriculum learning has shown promise in various natural language tasks, its impact on domain-specific applications like medical question answering remains under-explored. This study addresses this gap by evaluating multiple LLMs with different human-inspired learning strategies, focusing on their effectiveness in a medical context.

ðŸ”¹The study introduces a comprehensive evaluation of five learning strategies across four LLMs, emphasizing the variability in effectiveness depending on the model and dataset used. A significant finding is that LLM-defined difficulty measures can enhance the performance of curriculum learning, potentially serving as a cost-effective alternative to human annotations.

ðŸ”¹The research demonstrated that while human-inspired strategies generally improved model accuracy, their effectiveness varied across different models and datasets. The highest accuracy gains were modest, up to 1.81%, underscoring the importance of tailored approaches to model fine-tuning in specialized fields like medicine.

ðŸ”¹This study underscores the potential of integrating human-inspired learning strategies into LLM fine-tuning for medical applications. However, the variability in results suggests a need for careful consideration when applying these strategies across different contexts. Future research could expand on these findings by exploring broader datasets and more complex difficulty measures.
