Traditional virtual try-on (VTON) systems often face challenges in accurately representing garment details when applied to images of target individuals. These challenges include maintaining garment fidelity and avoiding distortions, especially when using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Diffusion models have emerged as an alternative due to their superior scalability and stability, but even they struggle to retain intricate garment textures.

Novelty: GarDiff sets itself apart by introducing a garment-focused diffusion process. It uses additional visual appearance priors from both the CLIP and VAE encodings of the reference garment. This amplified guidance ensures that every detail of the given garment is preserved during the diffusion process. The model incorporates a garment-focused adapter into the UNet of the diffusion model to align the visual appearance of the garment with the human pose, enhancing the generation of high-frequency texture details.

Key Findings: Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD and DressCode datasets show that GarDiff outperforms existing VTON approaches in terms of garment fidelity and overall image quality. The model demonstrates a significant improvement in preserving the texture and details of the garments, offering a more realistic virtual try-on experience.

GarDiff provides a new direction in the VTON field by focusing on both visual appearance and high-frequency details, offering a more realistic and detailed virtual try-on experience. Future work in this area could explore further refining the garment-focused guidance to enhance the performance and applicability of VTON systems in real-world scenarios.
