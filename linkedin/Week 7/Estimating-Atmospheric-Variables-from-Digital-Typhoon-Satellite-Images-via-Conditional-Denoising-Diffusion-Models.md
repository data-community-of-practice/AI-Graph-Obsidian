üìç This study introduces a novel approach to improving typhoon forecasting by leveraging the power of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (CDDPM). The study focuses on Taiwan, a region highly vulnerable to typhoons, and compares the performance of CDDPM with traditional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet).

üî∏ Challenges in Typhoon Forecasting: Typhoon forecasting, particularly in Taiwan, is critical for disaster preparedness. Traditional methods struggle with handling the complexity of the data and generating high-quality meteorological variables from noisy satellite images. Missing data and inconsistencies further complicate accurate forecasting.

üî∏ Capabilities of CDDPM: This model excels by using a diffusion process that transforms noisy satellite data into clean, usable meteorological variables. CDDPM outperforms other models in predicting variables such as wind speed, surface pressure, and temperature with greater accuracy. The model demonstrated superior results in key metrics like PSNR and RMSE.

üî∏ Performance and Flexibility: CDDPM achieves a 7.9% improvement over CNN and a 5.5% improvement over SENet in PSNR, proving its ability to generate more accurate meteorological predictions. It also offers high flexibility for imputation tasks, helping fill in gaps in meteorological datasets and providing more reliable data for forecasting.

üî∏ Impact and Future Directions: By improving the accuracy and quality of typhoon forecasting, CDDPM can significantly aid in disaster management and preparedness. Future research will focus on extending this approach to other weather phenomena and enhancing its robustness by incorporating multimodal data sources, such as radar.

üî∏ Contribution to Climate Science: This work establishes CDDPM as a leading tool in the field of meteorological forecasting, setting a new standard for predicting extreme weather events and contributing valuable insights into climate change and disaster management.
