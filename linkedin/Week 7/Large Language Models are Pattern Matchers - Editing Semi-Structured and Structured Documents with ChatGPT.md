ChatGPT: The Unexpected Document Editor - Revealing LLMs' Hidden Talents in Structured Data Processing

ðŸ“Œ Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing, but their potential in handling structured and semi-structured documents remains largely unexplored. This paper dives into uncharted territory, investigating how well LLMs can edit and convert structured documents with minimal human guidance. By putting ChatGPT to the test with LaTeX tables and bibliographic data formats, the research uncovers surprising strengths in pattern matching and structure comprehension, potentially opening new avenues for document processing and format conversion tasks.

ðŸ”¹ While LLMs excel at generating natural language, their ability to process structured documents remains underexplored. Traditional document editing and conversion often require specialized software or complex programming. This research investigates whether LLMs can perform these tasks efficiently with simple prompts, potentially streamlining document processing workflows.

ðŸ”¹ The study employs a qualitative approach, conducting detailed experiments with ChatGPT on LaTeX table restructuring and RIS to XML conversion. This method allows for in-depth analysis of the LLM's behavior, revealing impressive pattern matching abilities and structure comprehension. The research suggests that explicit structural annotations in prompts may enhance an LLM's task performance, offering insights for improving LLM-integrated applications.

ðŸ”¹ The experiments reveal that ChatGPT can effectively edit LaTeX tables and convert RIS to XML formats with simple prompts. The LLM demonstrated strong pattern matching skills, correctly handling varying field numbers and adapting information as needed. It showed particular proficiency in processing explicitly structured inputs, suggesting that clear structural annotations may improve LLMs' performance in document processing tasks.

ðŸ”¹ This research opens new possibilities for using LLMs in document processing and format conversion tasks. However, further studies are needed to explore this capability across a broader range of document types and LLMs. Future challenges include developing standardized methods for structuring prompts to optimize LLM performance in these tasks, and investigating how this pattern matching behavior relates to the phenomenon of hallucinations in LLMs.
