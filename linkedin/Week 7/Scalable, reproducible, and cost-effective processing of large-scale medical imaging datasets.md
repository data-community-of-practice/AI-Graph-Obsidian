**Context & Problem:**  
The paper addresses the difficulty in processing large-scale neuroimaging datasets, which are essential for research but require significant computational power and storage. Traditional methods either become too slow or financially prohibitive when scaled up for larger studies, creating bottlenecks in scientific research. The paper's goal is to resolve these challenges while ensuring reproducibility and cost efficiency.

**New Methodology:**  
The proposed method uses a Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)-compliant processing pipeline that leverages low-cost, high-efficiency computing resources. This method enables semi-automated data processing using parallel computing and containerization through Singularity images, significantly reducing financial overhead while maintaining processing speed comparable to cloud-based solutions. The novelty lies in its ability to combine flexibility, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness, crucial for neuroimaging studies.

**Key Findings:**  
- The method achieved a cost reduction of nearly 20 times compared to cloud-based processing systems.
- Data transfer speeds averaged 0.60 Gb/s, surpassing the speed of cloud-based methods (0.33 Gb/s).
- The system maintains flexibility for adding newly acquired data and ensures reproducibility through containerized environments.
- The processing time across various platforms was comparable, but the cost of cloud-based solutions was significantly higher.

**Conclusion & Interpretation:**  
This study demonstrates the feasibility of a scalable, cost-efficient solution for processing large-scale neuroimaging datasets. The next challenge lies in further optimizing the system for other imaging modalities and extending its use to broader research communities. Future directions include addressing the complexities of cloud setup and incorporating even faster transfer and processing solutions for larger datasets.
