üìç PrimeDepth presents an innovative solution for zero-shot monocular depth estimation using a highly efficient single-step diffusion-based approach. This method leverages a preimage derived from Stable Diffusion, offering fast and detailed depth predictions while significantly reducing the computational load, making it a transformative tool in the field.

üî∏ Challenges in Monocular Depth Estimation: Depth estimation from a single image has long been a complex task due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Traditional approaches often rely on large amounts of labeled data, which limits their generalization to unseen domains. Previous diffusion-based models, while accurate, have been inefficient due to multi-step denoising processes.

üî∏ Capabilities of PrimeDepth: PrimeDepth utilizes a novel approach, extracting a rich image representation from a single denoising step of Stable Diffusion. This preimage, combined with a refiner network, enables the model to deliver robust depth estimations quickly, outperforming the leading diffusion-based method, Marigold, by being 100x faster while retaining superior detail and robustness.

üî∏ Performance and Flexibility: PrimeDepth excels in zero-shot scenarios, maintaining high accuracy across diverse datasets such as KITTI and ETH3D, and proving its robustness in challenging conditions like nighttime scenes. By using only 74K synthetic training images, it competes closely with data-driven models like Depth Anything, which requires millions of images for training.

üî∏ Impact and Future Directions: PrimeDepth's fast and efficient inference opens new possibilities for real-time depth estimation applications in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics. Future work could involve integrating PrimeDepth‚Äôs preimage representation with other data-driven methods to further enhance performance and generalization capabilities.

üî∏ Contribution to Monocular Depth Estimation: By reducing the computational complexity and maintaining high accuracy, PrimeDepth sets a new benchmark in zero-shot monocular depth estimation. Its unique single-step diffusion approach revolutionizes the use of generative models for downstream tasks in computer vision.
