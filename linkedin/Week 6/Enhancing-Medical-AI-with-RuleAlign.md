üìç RuleAlign introduces an innovative framework designed to improve the diagnostic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by aligning them with specific medical diagnostic rules. This approach directly addresses the challenges LLMs face in mimicking the precision and efficiency of human physicians, particularly in gathering patient information and reasoning through diagnoses.

üî∏ *Challenges in Medical AI*: Despite their prowess, LLMs often struggle with the logical consistency required in medical diagnosis. They may suggest diagnoses without sufficient informational support or fail to adhere to professional guidelines, leading to inaccuracies in clinical settings.

üî∏ *Capabilities of RuleAlign*: The RuleAlign framework enhances LLMs by integrating rule-based alignment, ensuring their diagnostic processes adhere to established medical protocols. The framework introduces a specialized dataset, UrologyRD, designed to guide LLMs in urology by incorporating detailed diagnostic rules. This allows LLMs to simulate physician-patient dialogues more accurately and reliably, improving their ability to provide well-supported diagnoses.

üî∏ *Performance and Flexibility*: Through extensive testing on multiple LLMs, RuleAlign has demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and logical coherence. The framework reduces perplexity, enhances ROUGE and BLEU scores, and maintains a modular design that allows easy adaptation to various medical domains, making it a versatile tool for the broader medical AI community.

üî∏ *Impact and Future Directions*: RuleAlign sets a new standard for LLM-based diagnostics by aligning AI outputs with clinical expectations. The future focus will include expanding the framework to cover more medical specialties and enhancing its ability to handle complex, multi-round patient interactions, thereby pushing the boundaries of what medical AI can achieve.

üî∏ *Contribution to Medical AI*: By offering a robust approach to aligning LLMs with professional diagnostic standards, RuleAlign plays a critical role in advancing AI-driven healthcare. This framework not only bridges the gap between AI and human expertise but also paves the way for safer and more reliable AI-assisted medical practices.
