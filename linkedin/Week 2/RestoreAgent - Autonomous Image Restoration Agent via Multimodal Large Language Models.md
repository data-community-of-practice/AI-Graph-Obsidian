1️⃣ **Context and Problem Statement**: In the domain of image restoration, traditional methods often rely on manual selection and fixed sequences of specific tasks, such as denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. These methods struggle with real-world images that frequently suffer from multiple, simultaneous degradations. All-in-one models, while capable of addressing multiple degradations within a single framework, often face trade-offs between generalization and performance, leading to suboptimal restoration outcomes with overly smooth or low-fidelity results.

2️⃣ **Novel Methodology and Contributions**: **RestoreAgent** represents a significant advancement in image restoration, utilizing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to autonomously manage the restoration process. The system comprises several key components which are Degradation Type Identification, Adaptive Restoration Sequence, Optimal Model Selection, Automated Execution.
3️⃣ **Key Findings**: The extensive experiments conducted demonstrate that RestoreAgent significantly outperforms both traditional methods and human experts. The system excels in handling complex degradations across various imaging scenarios, delivering superior results in metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), and Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS). The modular design of RestoreAgent facilitates rapid integration of new tasks and models, making it a flexible and scalable solution for diverse image restoration challenges.

4️⃣ **Conclusion and Future Directions**: This study highlights the importance of task sequence and model selection in processing multi-degraded images. RestoreAgent, an innovative agent model, outperforms traditional all-in-one methods and human experts by making intelligent, tailored processing decisions. However, the research is limited by the narrow scope of models and tasks examined, and the existing models' limited generalization capabilities. Future work will focus on expanding RestoreAgent's model and task range, enhancing its adaptability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios by incorporating a broader set of state-of-the-art models. This will ensure a more robust and versatile image restoration framework.
