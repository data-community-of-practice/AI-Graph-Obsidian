No-Data Defense: Robustifying AI with Text-to-Image Models

ðŸ“Œ Adversarial robustness in image classification models remains a significant hurdle, especially for pre-trained models where training data access is restricted or non-existent. This paper proposes an innovative method that utilizes text-to-image diffusion models to achieve adversarial robustness without relying on external data. By redefining these generative models as versatile denoisers, the researchers offer a scalable and model-independent approach that not only boosts robustness but also preserves or enhances classification accuracy across various tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Adversarial robustness has traditionally been achieved through specialized training schemes that require substantial amounts of data. However, with the increasing use of off-the-shelf models in various applications, access to original training data is often limited or impractical. This creates a significant challenge in securing these models against adversarial attacks, especially when incorporating them into security-sensitive applications.

ðŸ”¹ This study innovatively uses text-to-image diffusion models in a "denoise-and-classify" pipeline to enhance adversarial robustness. The researchers propose a three-step framework: generating synthetic reference images using text-to-image models, fine-tuning the diffusion model with a classifier-guided technique, and adapting the classifier with these denoised samples. This approach achieves robust classification without real training data, making it suitable for a wide array of pre-trained models with limited data access. The framework notably improves classification accuracy and provides robustness guarantees, sometimes outperforming methods that utilize complete training datasets.

ðŸ”¹ The framework demonstrated remarkable results across various models and datasets. When applied to CLIP for zero-shot classification, it outperformed methods using full ImageNet data, achieving a 16.6% gain in robust accuracy at Îµ = 0.5 on ImageNet. For a pre-trained ResNet-50, it boosted robust accuracy by 51.8% at Îµ = 0.5. Importantly, these improvements came without sacrificing clean accuracy, often even enhancing it. These findings highlight the framework's effectiveness in robustifying diverse classifiers without requiring access to training data, marking a significant advance in adversarial robustness research.

ðŸ”¹ This study opens new avenues for practical adversarial robustness in off-the-shelf models. While promising, future challenges include extending the framework to other domains like natural language processing (NLP) and optimizing inference costs. As AI systems become more prevalent in security-sensitive applications, this data-free approach could be crucial in enhancing the reliability of deployed models, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy AI.
