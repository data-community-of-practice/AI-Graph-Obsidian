## RestoreAgent Autonomous Image Restoration Agent via Multimodal Large Language Models

The field of image restoration is witnessing a transformative leap with the introduction of **RestoreAgent**, an advanced system designed to tackle complex image degradations. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of traditional and all-in-one models by autonomously assessing and restoring images with multiple types of degradation, such as noise, blur, and low light. RestoreAgent leverages state-of-the-art AI techniques, including multimodal large language models (MLLM), to optimize the restoration process.

1️⃣ **Context and Problem Statement**: In the domain of image restoration, traditional methods often rely on manual selection and fixed sequences of specific tasks, such as denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. These methods struggle with real-world images that frequently suffer from multiple, simultaneous degradations. All-in-one models, while capable of addressing multiple degradations within a single framework, often face trade-offs between generalization and performance, leading to suboptimal restoration outcomes with overly smooth or low-fidelity results.

2️⃣ **Novel Methodology and Contributions**: **RestoreAgent** represents a significant advancement in image restoration, utilizing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to autonomously manage the restoration process. The system comprises several key components:
   - **Degradation Type Identification**: RestoreAgent first identifies the types and severity of degradations present in the input image. This is crucial for tailoring the restoration process to the specific needs of the image.
   - **Adaptive Restoration Sequence**: Unlike traditional fixed-sequence methods, RestoreAgent dynamically determines the optimal sequence of restoration tasks. This decision-making process considers the specific degradation patterns and their interdependencies, optimizing the order in which tasks are executed.
   - **Optimal Model Selection**: For each identified degradation, RestoreAgent selects the most appropriate model from a pool of specialized models. This selection process ensures that the best-suited techniques are applied to address each degradation type, thereby enhancing the overall restoration quality.
   - **Automated Execution**: Once the degradation types, task sequence, and models are determined, RestoreAgent autonomously executes the entire restoration pipeline, ensuring a streamlined and efficient process without the need for manual intervention.

3️⃣ **Key Findings**: The extensive experiments conducted demonstrate that RestoreAgent significantly outperforms both traditional methods and human experts. The system excels in handling complex degradations across various imaging scenarios, delivering superior results in metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), and Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS). The modular design of RestoreAgent facilitates rapid integration of new tasks and models, making it a flexible and scalable solution for diverse image restoration challenges.

4️⃣ **Conclusion and Future Directions**: This study highlights the importance of task sequence and model selection in processing multi-degraded images. RestoreAgent, an innovative agent model, outperforms traditional all-in-one methods and human experts by making intelligent, tailored processing decisions. However, the research is limited by the narrow scope of models and tasks examined, and the existing models' limited generalization capabilities. Future work will focus on expanding RestoreAgent's model and task range, enhancing its adaptability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios by incorporating a broader set of state-of-the-art models. This will ensure a more robust and versatile image restoration framework.
