Image Processing Plugins for the Web via JavaScript Injection

ðŸ“Œ Boostlet.js is an open-source library designed to integrate advanced image processing capabilities into existing web-based visualization frameworks through JavaScript injection. It provides image processing plugins, accessible via a simple API, and deployable as bookmarklets. This framework addresses the limitations of current web-based visualization tools, which often lack advanced processing features and require significant development effort to add new functionalities. Boostlet.js supports various frameworks like Cornerstone2D, NiiVue, OpenSeaDragon, Xtk, and Papaya, enabling enhanced image processing directly within the browser using consumer-level hardware.

ðŸ”¹ Traditional web-based visualization frameworks for biomedical images, such as Cornerstone2D and NiiVue, primarily focus on visualization and offer limited processing capabilities. Boostlet.js addresses this challenge by providing a modular, easy-to-use solution that extends the capabilities of existing frameworks through JavaScript injection, facilitating the development and sharing of image processing plugins.

ðŸ”¹ Boostlet.js introduces a novel approach to integrating image processing functionalities into web-based visualization frameworks. Using a browser bookmark to inject a user-friendly plugin selection tool called PowerBoost, users can access pre-built image processing functionalities like kernel filtering, segmentation, and web-optimized machine-learning models. The library's modular architecture allows for client-side processing and ensures cross-framework compatibility.

ðŸ”¹ Boostlet.js enables users to perform advanced image processing tasks directly within the browser without needing to download or transfer data to external tools. The library supports multiple popular visualization frameworks, ensuring wide applicability and ease of use. Automated integration testing and comprehensive documentation ensure the reliability and usability of the Boostlet.js library.

ðŸ”¹ Boostlet.js enhances the capabilities of web-based visualization frameworks by providing a unified programming interface for image processing. This development allows researchers and developers to create, share, and apply advanced image processing techniques easily. Future challenges include expanding the library's support for 3D and WebGL/WebGPU frameworks to enhance pixel manipulation capabilities further. Additionally, continued community engagement and feedback will be crucial in refining the library and adding more functionalities to meet the evolving needs of the medical imaging and visualization community.
