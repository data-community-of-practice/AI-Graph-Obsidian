ðŸ”¹ Traditional web-based visualization frameworks for biomedical images, such as Cornerstone2D and NiiVue, primarily focus on visualization and offer limited processing capabilities. Enhancing these frameworks with advanced image processing functionalities often requires substantial software development with specific programming interfaces. Boostlet.js addresses this challenge by providing a modular, easy-to-use, and open-source solution that can extend the capabilities of existing frameworks through JavaScript injection, thereby facilitating the development and sharing of image processing plugins.

ðŸ”¹ Boostlet.js introduces a novel approach to integrating image processing functionalities into web-based visualization frameworks. By using a browser bookmark to inject a user-friendly plugin selection tool called PowerBoost into any compatible website, users can access a variety of pre-built image processing functionalities, such as kernel filtering, segmentation, and web-optimized machine-learning models. The library's modular architecture allows for client-side processing and ensures cross-framework compatibility, making it a significant contribution to the field of web-based image processing and visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Boostlet.js enables users to perform advanced image processing tasks, such as segmentation and filtering, directly within the browser without needing to download or transfer data to external tools. The library supports multiple popular visualization frameworks, ensuring wide applicability and ease of use. Boostlet.js simplifies the development and sharing of new image processing plugins, fostering collaboration and innovation within the medical imaging community. Automated integration testing and comprehensive documentation ensure the reliability and usability of the Boostlet.js library.

ðŸ”¹ Boostlet.js enhances the capabilities of web-based visualization frameworks by providing a unified programming interface for image processing. This development allows researchers and developers to create, share, and apply advanced image processing techniques easily. Future challenges include expanding the library's support for 3D and WebGL/WebGPU frameworks to enhance pixel manipulation capabilities further. Additionally, continued community engagement and feedback will be crucial in refining the library and adding more functionalities to meet the evolving needs of the medical imaging and visualization community.
