üìç BUSClean introduces a transformative open-source software solution for the pre-processing of breast ultrasound (BUS) images, enhancing the data quality for medical AI applications. This tool addresses the challenge of irregularities and artifacts in clinical BUS datasets, which can skew AI training and diagnostics.

üî∏ *Challenges in BUS Image Pre-processing*: Unlike standardised medical imaging modalities, BUS images often include a variety of irregularities such as non-standard scan modes and embedded text annotations. These can introduce significant noise into AI models, leading to poor generalization and diagnostic inaccuracies.

üî∏ *Capabilities of BUSClean*: BUSClean automates the cleaning, filtering, and knowledge extraction processes for BUS images. It effectively identifies and processes artifacts, text annotations, and non-standard imaging modes using advanced image processing and OCR techniques. This ensures that AI models train on high-quality data, leading to more reliable and robust medical imaging AI systems.

üî∏ *Performance and Flexibility*: Tested on both internal and external datasets, BUSClean has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in handling various types of image artifacts and annotations. Its modular design allows for easy customization and adaptation to new datasets, making it a versatile tool for researchers worldwide.

üî∏ *Impact and Future Directions*: BUSClean not only improves the quality of AI training data but also sets a new standard in the preprocessing of medical images. Future enhancements will focus on expanding its adaptability and integrating more advanced AI techniques for even more comprehensive image analysis.

üî∏ *Contribution to Medical AI*: By providing a robust framework for data curation in medical imaging, BUSClean plays a crucial role in the development of AI diagnostics, particularly in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer.
