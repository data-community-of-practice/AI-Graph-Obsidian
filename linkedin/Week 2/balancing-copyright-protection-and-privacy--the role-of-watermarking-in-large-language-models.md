Balancing Copyright Protection and Privacy: The Role of Watermarking in Large Language Models

ðŸ“Œ This paper explores the intersection of copyright protection and privacy in large language models (LLMs). It addresses the critical issue of preventing unauthorized use of copyrighted content and the detection of such content in training datasets. The study investigates the effectiveness of watermarking techniques in preventing the generation of copyrighted text and examines its unintended impact on the success of membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine if a specific data sample was used in training the model.

ðŸ”¹ The research focuses on two major challenges in LLMs: preventing the generation of copyrighted content and detecting copyrighted content in training data. Unauthorized use of copyrighted content raises significant legal and ethical issues, as it can violate intellectual property rights and lead to privacy breaches.

ðŸ”¹ The paper introduces watermarking as a method to embed identifiable markers in the output of LLMs. This technique aims to make it significantly less likely for models to generate copyrighted content. The novelty of this approach lies in its capability to effectively prevent unauthorized content generation. By altering the logit distribution during the decoding process, watermarking embeds detectable signals that complicate the extraction of training data, thereby enhancing copyright protection.

ðŸ”¹ The study demonstrates that watermarking can significantly reduce the probability of generating copyrighted content, sometimes by orders of magnitude. However, watermarking also has the unintended consequence of decreasing the success rate of MIAs by altering the probability distribution of output tokens, which impacts detection methods. For instance, experiments with the University of Maryland (UMD) watermarking scheme showed that the accuracy of methods used to detect if specific data was part of the training set can drop by up to 16%. This means that while watermarking is effective in preventing unauthorized content generation, it also makes it harder to identify if copyrighted material was used during training. Furthermore, the research proposes an adaptive method that leverages knowledge of watermarking schemes to enhance the detection performance of MIAs under watermarking conditions. This method adjusts the modelâ€™s output to counteract the perturbations introduced by watermarks, thereby improving the detection of pretraining data.

ðŸ”¹ The paper concludes that watermarking presents a promising solution to prevent the generation of copyrighted content. However, it also complicates the detection of copyright violations during training by reducing the success rate of MIAs. Future work should focus on exploring different types of watermarking methods beyond decoding time techniques and refining adaptive methods to ensure robust copyright protection and data privacy. Additionally, the research encourages the development of more sophisticated adaptive attack methodologies to stay ahead of advances in defense mechanisms.
