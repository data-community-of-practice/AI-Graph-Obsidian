Balancing Copyright Protection and Privacy: The Role of Watermarking in Large Language Models

ðŸ“Œ This paper explores the intersection of copyright protection and privacy in large language models (LLMs). It addresses the critical issue of preventing unauthorized use of copyrighted content and the detection of such content in training datasets. The study investigates the effectiveness of watermarking techniques in preventing the generation of copyrighted text and examines its unintended impact on the success of membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine if a specific data sample was used in training the model.

ðŸ”¹ The research focuses on two major challenges in LLMs: preventing the generation of copyrighted content and detecting copyrighted content in training data. Unauthorized use of copyrighted content raises significant legal and ethical issues, as it can violate intellectual property rights and lead to privacy breaches.

ðŸ”¹ The paper introduces watermarking as a method to embed identifiable markers in the output of LLMs, aiming to reduce the likelihood of generating copyrighted content. This novel approach effectively prevents unauthorized content generation. By altering the logit distribution, which represents the model's confidence in predicting the next word, watermarking embeds detectable signals that complicate the identification of training data, thus preventing the extraction of copyrighted content and enhancing copyright protection.

ðŸ”¹ The study demonstrates that watermarking can significantly reduce the probability of generating copyrighted content, sometimes by orders of magnitude. However, it also unintentionally decreases the success rate of MIAs by altering the probability distribution of output tokens. This happens because the watermark reduces the distinctiveness of the training data's signature, making it harder to distinguish between data used in training and data not used. To address this, the research proposes an adaptive method that adjusts the modelâ€™s output to counteract these perturbations, thereby improving the detection of pretraining data under watermarking conditions.

ðŸ”¹ The paper concludes that watermarking is a promising solution for preventing the generation of copyrighted content, but it complicates detecting copyright violations during training by reducing the success rate of MIAs. Future work should explore different watermarking methods beyond decoding techniques and refine adaptive methods to ensure robust copyright protection and data privacy. Additionally, the research encourages developing more sophisticated adaptive attack methodologies to stay ahead of defense mechanism advances.
