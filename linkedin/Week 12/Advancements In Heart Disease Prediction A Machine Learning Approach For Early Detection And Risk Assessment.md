ðŸ“Œ This paper focuses on the application of machine learning techniques for early detection and risk assessment of heart disease, which is one of the leading causes of death globally. The paper explores various machine learning models and evaluates their effectiveness in predicting heart disease from clinical data. It specifically highlights the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the most accurate model among the seven tested models in this study.

ðŸ”¹ Heart disease is a major health concern worldwide, and early detection is essential to prevent fatal outcomes. The paper addresses the challenge of accurately predicting heart disease by using machine learning algorithms, aiming to enhance clinical decision-making, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce healthcare burdens.

ðŸ”¹The novelty of the study lies in its comprehensive evaluation of seven different machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM, for heart disease prediction. It highlights the Support Vector Machineâ€™s high accuracy (91.51%) as a significant contribution, showing its potential for real-time application in personalized healthcare and risk management.

ðŸ”¹The key findings of the research demonstrate that the SVM model outperforms other machine learning models in predicting heart disease, achieving the highest accuracy rate of 91.51%. Logistic Regression and Random Forest also perform well, but SVM's robustness in handling complex datasets gives it a significant edge in clinical settings.

ðŸ”¹ The study concludes that machine learning models, particularly the SVM model, can significantly improve the early detection and prediction of heart disease. Future challenges include integrating more advanced models, improving accuracy, and further developing these techniques to support clinical applications in personalized medicine, helping to reduce mortality rates.
