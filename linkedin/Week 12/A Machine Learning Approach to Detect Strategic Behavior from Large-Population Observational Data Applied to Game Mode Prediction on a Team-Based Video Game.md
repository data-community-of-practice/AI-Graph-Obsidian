Traditional game theory assumes that agents have perfect information about the system and other participants, which often does not hold true in real-world settings. In many multiplayer online games, players’ actions are observable, but their underlying preferences and strategies remain hidden. Detecting whether players act strategically, even without knowing their motivations, can help justify the use of more complex game-theoretic models.

Novelty: The paper proposes a machine learning approach to assess strategic behavior without requiring information on payoffs or detailed preferences. It involves training neural networks to predict game mode selections for players using different feature sets. First, baseline models are trained using only player-specific features like hero choice and time of day. Then, new models incorporate historical co-play features, representing players' interactions with others over time. Improved prediction accuracy with these additional features suggests strategic behavior among players.

Key Findings:

1. Incorporating historical co-play features significantly improved game mode prediction accuracy, indicating that players likely consider their previous interactions with others when making decisions.
2. The study revealed that not all players acted strategically; improvements in prediction accuracy varied, with some players showing up to a 23% increase in prediction accuracy when co-play data was used.
3. The results demonstrate that a subset of players engage in strategic coordination, while others act independently, which has implications for designing more nuanced game models.

This paper offers a first step toward using machine learning to detect strategic behavior in multi-agent systems where only actions are observable. The proposed approach provides a way to identify when agents’ decisions are influenced by the behavior of others, thus justifying the use of more advanced game-theoretic models. It has potential applications beyond gaming, in areas like economics and social media analysis, where understanding strategic interactions is crucial.
