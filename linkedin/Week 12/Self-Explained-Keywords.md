Empowering Code Generation with Self-Explained Keywords (SEK)  
Link to Article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15966

üìç Overview: SEK is a breakthrough in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for code generation, tackling the challenge of low-frequency, problem-specific keywords that often reduce code accuracy. By automatically identifying and explaining key terms within prompts, SEK improves the quality of LLM-generated code for complex tasks.

üî∏ Challenge of Low-Frequency Keywords: Traditional LLMs can overlook niche terms due to their infrequency in training, often missing problem-specific details. SEK tackles this gap by guiding models to recognize and prioritize these critical keywords, boosting accuracy in understanding and code generation.

üî∏ Capabilities of SEK: SEK uses a three-stage approach:

- KeyExtract & Explain: By leveraging the LLM‚Äôs comprehension abilities, SEK identifies and explains key keywords within a problem‚Äôs context.
- KeyRank: Keywords are ranked based on frequency and relevance, focusing on those that are underrepresented in typical training data but essential to the task.
- PromptEnrich: These ranked keywords are appended to the problem description, creating a refined prompt that directs the LLM‚Äôs attention to core concepts.

üî∏ Performance and Flexibility: Evaluated across multiple benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, APPS), SEK consistently outperforms traditional approaches, enhancing Pass@1 scores in models like Llama-3 and GPT-3.5. Its modular design makes SEK highly adaptable, allowing customization to new datasets and a wide range of programming problems.

üî∏ Impact and Future Directions: SEK not only raises the bar for prompt engineering but also sets a new standard in LLM-driven code generation. Future advancements will streamline SEK‚Äôs efficiency and further improve its keyword extraction process to handle increasingly complex coding tasks.

üî∏ Contribution to AI-Driven Development: By addressing the long-tail problem of code-specific keywords, SEK strengthens LLMs' reliability, helping developers produce more robust, task-specific solutions and advancing capabilities in AI-driven software development.
