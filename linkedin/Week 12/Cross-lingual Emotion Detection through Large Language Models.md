Accurately identifying emotions from text across languages is critical for global applications, but many models struggle to generalize well when processing diverse languages. Traditional models often need extensive fine-tuning and data in each language to perform well. This paper focuses on using LLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations to detect emotions in five languages: English, French, Dutch, Russian, and Spanish.

Novelty: The key innovation of this approach lies in its use of an ensemble of models, including open-source models like LLAMA-3-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-v2-7B, alongside proprietary systems like GPT-4 and Claude-Opus. The proprietary models were used in zero-shot configurations, while the open models were fine-tuned on a multilingual dataset over several epochs. The study also explored the trade-offs between using 4-bit and 16-bit precision in model performance, offering insights into balancing computational efficiency and accuracy.

Key Findings:
1) The ensemble approach significantly outperformed individual models, achieving the best results through a majority voting system among the models.
2) The fine-tuned models, particularly LLAMA-3-8B and Mistral-v2-7B, showed strong performance in languages with less training data.
3) The analysis revealed that different models excelled in different languages, suggesting that selecting a model based on the target language can improve overall accuracy.
4) Error analysis indicated that fine-tuned models handled "neutral" class texts better, whereas proprietary models were more prone to misclassifying these.

The paper demonstrates that using a diverse ensemble of LLMs, both fine-tuned and zero-shot, can effectively address the challenges of cross-lingual emotion detection. This approach allows for better generalization across languages without requiring extensive training data for each one. The insights gained from this study could be applied to other multilingual text classification tasks, offering a pathway for improved emotion analysis in global applications.
