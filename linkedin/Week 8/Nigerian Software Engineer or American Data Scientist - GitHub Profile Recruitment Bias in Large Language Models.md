As Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT become more prevalent in automating tasks, they are now even being considered for recruitment processes. But what if these models exhibit biases? Takashi Nakano et al. explores whether LLMs show preferences based on location and other factors when selecting software developers.

1) Context: As LLMs are increasingly used for recruitment in software engineering, concerns arise about their fairness. This study investigates whether OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, used in recruitment tasks, shows bias when selecting candidates from various regions, including the United States, India, Nigeria, and Poland, based on GitHub profiles.

2)  Novelty: The paper presents the first large-scale experiment focused on location-based bias in AI-assisted recruitment. The researchers explored how GPT-4 recruits software developers and allocates roles based on region, shedding light on potential biases that might exist within these models.

3)  Key Findings:
- ChatGPT favored developers from some regions over others, even when using counterfactuals (swapping location data). For instance, candidates from the United States and Poland were favored less when their location was altered.
- The model assigned roles like data scientist or software engineer based on location, with American candidates often assigned data scientist roles and Nigerian candidates frequently assigned as software engineers.

This study is a wake-up call to the industry, indicating that LLMs, while powerful, are not immune to biases. The paper calls for further investigation into how these biases manifest and proposes research agendas to address them. The findings suggest the need for bias mitigation strategies before LLMs can be relied upon in recruitment settings.
