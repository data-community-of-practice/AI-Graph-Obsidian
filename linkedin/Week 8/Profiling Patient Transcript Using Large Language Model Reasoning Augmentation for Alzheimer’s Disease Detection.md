Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive abilities, including speech and language skills. Early detection of Alzheimer’s is critical for improving outcomes, but traditional methods can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advancements in deep learning offer an opportunity to automate this process through analysis of patient speech patterns. Chin-Po Chen et al. proposes an innovative approach to improving the detection of Alzheimer’s disease using large language models (LLMs) to analyze patient transcripts.

1) Novelty: The core contribution of this study is the introduction of a reasoning-augmented framework that profiles patient transcripts by extracting linguistic deficit attributes using LLMs. Unlike traditional methods that focus on individual utterances, this approach generates a comprehensive patient profile by summarizing language deficits such as pauses, poor grammar, or lack of coherence. These profiles are then integrated with an Albert (a BERT-like model) to improve the accuracy of AD detection.

2) Key Findings:

- The model significantly improves detection performance, with an 8.51% increase in F1 score and an 8.34% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline models on the ADReSS dataset.

- The framework identifies linguistic deficit attributes across patient speech, which enhances the model’s interpretability, allowing for better clinical insights.

- It also introduces new linguistic attributes related to cognitive decline, such as limited recall of details and misuse of pronouns, providing a more detailed understanding of speech patterns associated with AD.

The study demonstrates that reasoning-augmented large language models can enhance both the accuracy and interpretability of Alzheimer’s disease detection from speech transcripts. By profiling linguistic deficits at a patient level, the framework not only improves detection but also offers potential for clinical application, enabling more explainable AI in healthcare settings.
