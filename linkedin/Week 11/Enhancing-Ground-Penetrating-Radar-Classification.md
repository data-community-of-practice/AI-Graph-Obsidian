üìç Second-Order Deep Learning Models introduce a cutting-edge solution for classifying buried objects using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) images. This innovative approach leverages the power of covariance matrices to improve the robustness and accuracy of classification, even in challenging conditions with limited or noisy data.

üî∏ Challenges in GPR Image Classification: GPR is a widely used tool for detecting underground objects, but the noisy nature of GPR images makes classification difficult. The influence of various factors such as soil type, radar frequency, and object materials introduces complexities that traditional classification models often fail to handle efficiently. Additionally, gathering large, well-labeled datasets for GPR can be time-consuming and expensive.

üî∏ Capabilities of the Proposed Models: By transforming GPR images into covariance matrices and utilizing specific layers designed to classify Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, these second-order models demonstrate significant improvements over shallow networks and conventional CNNs. These models not only outperform others when data is limited but also show resilience when training data is mislabeled or derived from varying conditions such as different radar frequencies or soil types.

üî∏ Performance and Flexibility: Tested on a dataset provided by Geolithe, the models exhibited superior accuracy and robustness across various experimental setups. Whether dealing with shifts in data from different radar elevations or frequencies, the second-order models consistently outperformed both shallow and deep learning models. This makes them highly suitable for real-world applications where data variability is a constant challenge.

üî∏ Impact and Future Directions: These second-order deep learning models represent a major advancement in GPR-based buried object classification. Future work will focus on refining the approach further and expanding its applicability to other domains of radar signal processing and object classification.

üî∏ Contribution to Radar Signal Processing: By offering a more resilient and adaptable classification framework, these models have the potential to significantly improve the detection and classification of underground objects, contributing to advancements in civil engineering, archaeology, and defense sectors.
