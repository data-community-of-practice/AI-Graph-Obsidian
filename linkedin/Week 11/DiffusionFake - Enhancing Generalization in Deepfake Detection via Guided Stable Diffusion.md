Deepfake detection is crucial as forged content can lead to the spread of misinformation, identity theft, and other malicious activities. Traditional detection methods tend to overfit specific forgery types, meaning they fail to perform well when encountering new or different types of forgeries. Diffusion models, commonly used in generative tasks, are now being explored to help in detection tasks by improving the ability of models to generalize across diverse deepfake methods.

Novelty: The DiffusionFake framework applies Stable Diffusion, a generative model, to deepfake detection by reversing the forgery process. By using features extracted from the forgery detection model and injecting them into a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, DiffusionFake forces the detector to reconstruct both the source and target images used in the forgery. This helps the model learn to identify distinctive features related to both the source and the target, leading to better detection accuracy, even on unseen forgery types.

Key Findings:
1) DiffusionFake significantly enhances the ability of detection models to generalize to unseen deepfakes, improving performance across several datasets.
2) The framework achieves a 10% improvement in AUC scores on the Celeb-DF dataset when integrated with EfficientNet-B4, one of the backbone architectures for detection.
3) The framework operates without adding any computational overhead during inference, making it efficient for real-world applications.

This paper demonstrates that using diffusion models for deepfake detection can greatly improve a modelâ€™s ability to generalize to unseen forgery types. The DiffusionFake framework is a promising solution that leverages the power of generative models to enhance detection capabilities while remaining computationally efficient.
