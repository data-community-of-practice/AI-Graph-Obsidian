ChatGPT Redefines Conversational Search: Unlocking Precision Through Intelligent Query Rewriting

**Article link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07797

ðŸ“ŒConversational search is transforming how users interact with information retrieval systems, but maintaining precision through context shifts and ambiguities poses significant challenges. A new study explores the ability of instructed large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, to improve search performance by rewriting user queries in conversational contexts.

ðŸ”¹In modern search, fragmented or ambiguous queries often reduce accuracy, especially within multi-turn dialogues. This study addresses the limitations of conventional search models, which struggle with missing context or topic shifts. By employing instructed LLMs, the research examines whether smart query rewrites can better align user intent with search engine performance, ultimately bridging conversational gaps.

ðŸ”¹The study introduces five specialized prompting techniques designed to enhance LLM-driven query rewrites. Each prompt adapts ChatGPT to different conversation structures, ensuring queries remain context-aware and complete. Using the TREC CAsT dataset, the paper demonstrates how such rewriting not only maintains fluency but significantly boosts retrieval metrics across various conversational scenarios.

ðŸ”¹Through rigorous testing, the research highlights remarkable improvements, including a 31.7% boost in precision and 27% increase in retrieval quality (NDCG@3) over traditional methods. The results underscore how instructed LLMs effectively mitigate the pitfalls of ambiguous user utterances, outperforming state-of-the-art query rewriting models in multi-turn dialogues.

ðŸ”¹This study exemplifies the power of ChatGPT to drive smarter search experiences by resolving conversational complexities. The demonstrated improvements have broad implications across industriesâ€”from customer support to virtual assistants. Looking forward, this approach opens doors for more personalized interactions and enhanced search precision in AI-powered services.
