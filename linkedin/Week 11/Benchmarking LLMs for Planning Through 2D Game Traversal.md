ðŸ“Œ The paper presents a novel benchmark called GameTraversalBenchmark (GTB) to evaluate the planning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It addresses the question of whether LLMs, known for generating natural language, can effectively plan beyond language-based tasks by navigating through 2D grid-based game maps. The problem it tackles is evaluating LLMs' ability to traverse game maps, an underexplored area that challenges their planning skills.

ðŸ”¹ The paper investigates the planning capabilities of LLMs, such as GPT-4, by introducing a new benchmark for evaluating these modelsâ€™ ability to navigate 2D maps through a series of objectives with minimal errors and steps.

ðŸ”¹The paper's primary contribution is the GTB, a dataset consisting of diverse 2D game maps. The novelty lies in testing LLMs in an unfamiliar task, emphasizing planning as opposed to typical language generation tasks. This offers a new avenue for evaluating LLMs' general intelligence and reasoning abilities.

ðŸ”¹The results show that while GPT-4-Turbo performed best among evaluated models, none of the models achieved high performance on the benchmark, with even the top model scoring below 50%. The results reveal a significant gap in current LLMs' planning capabilities.

ðŸ”¹ The study concludes that LLMs are not yet proficient in planning tasks such as game traversal. Future challenges include improving LLMs' planning abilities and exploring fine-tuning models on tasks like GTB to enhance their performance. Expanding the benchmark to include more complex scenarios, such as moving enemies or dynamic environments, could also present additional challenges for future research
