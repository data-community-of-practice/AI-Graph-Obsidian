# A Teaching-Inspired Framework for Enhancing Arithmetic Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Introduction
This paper introduces a novel Teaching-Inspired Integrated Prompting Framework aimed at improving the arithmetic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While recent advances in prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have shown promise, they often overlook the need for explicit prior knowledge, such as mathematical concepts, theorems, and problem-solving strategies. This paper addresses this gap by incorporating a structured, teacher-like guidance system into the LLM prompting process, significantly enhancing the model's reasoning accuracy on arithmetic tasks.

1️⃣ **Problem Context** 
Current LLMs struggle with arithmetic reasoning, even with state-of-the-art prompting techniques. Existing methods like CoT prompting improve performance by providing intermediate reasoning steps but lack the deep integration of essential mathematical knowledge. This limitation often results in inaccurate answers, especially for complex problems that require a conceptual understanding of underlying theorems and solution methods.

2️⃣ **Novel Methodology/Framework**  
The proposed Teaching-Inspired Integrated Prompting Framework mimics the role of a teacher by equipping LLMs with foundational concepts, relevant theorems, and similar example problems. The framework improves reasoning by:
- Providing background knowledge retrieval from educational databases.
- Introducing a double-check mechanism through Python program generation and solution verification.
- Using majority voting across multiple solution paths to select the most accurate result.  
Additionally, the authors created two new Chinese mathematical datasets, MathMC and MathToF, to evaluate the framework.

3️⃣ **Key Findings**
Experimental results on nine benchmarks demonstrate that this framework significantly improves arithmetic reasoning performance. Using GPT-4, the framework achieved new state-of-the-art results on four major benchmarks—AddSub, SVAMP, Math23K, and AQuA—with accuracy improvements of up to 7.2%. Notably, it outperformed existing CoT methods, boosting performance by 24.8% on the Math23K dataset and 8.8% on GSM8K.

4️⃣ **Conclusion and Future Challenges**
The Teaching-Inspired Integrated Prompting Framework represents a substantial advancement in LLM reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematical domains. Future challenges include extending the framework to more general reasoning tasks and enhancing its effectiveness in multi-lingual contexts. The paper also suggests that improving dataset diversity could further boost model performance in arithmetic reasoning.
