ðŸ”¹ The primary problem is the complexity and manual effort involved in building machine learning models for multimodal data, which integrates various data types such as text, images, and tabular data. Traditional AutoML frameworks are not fully equipped to handle this complexity, often requiring extensive manual feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

ðŸ”¹ AutoM3L introduces an innovative framework that utilizes LLMs as controllers to automatically construct and optimize multimodal machine learning pipelines. This framework simplifies user engagement by eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization. The significant contribution of AutoM3L lies in its ability to provide a more automated, interactive, and customizable solution compared to existing rule-based AutoML approaches.

ðŸ”¹ The evaluation of AutoM3L on six diverse multimodal datasets demonstrates its superior performance over traditional rule-based AutoML methods. It achieves competitive or better results in classification, regression, and retrieval tasks. Additionally, a user study highlights the framework's enhanced usability and user-friendliness.

ðŸ”¹ The paper concludes that AutoM3L marks a significant advancement in automated multimodal machine learning, offering a scalable and adaptable solution. Future challenges include extending the framework to support a wider range of data modalities, such as graph, audio, and point clouds, to further enhance its applicability and performance.
