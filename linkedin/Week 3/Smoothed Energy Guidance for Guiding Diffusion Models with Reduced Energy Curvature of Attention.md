### Smoothed Energy Guidance - Guiding Diffusion Models with Reduced Energy Curvature of Attention

This paper explores a novel technique for improving diffusion models through Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG). Conditional diffusion models excel in image generation using classifier-free guidance (CFG). Extending these benefits to unconditional models has struggled with heuristic methods leading to suboptimal results. We present Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), an innovative approach that enhances image generation by optimizing the energy landscape of self-attention mechanisms. SEG refines this energy using Gaussian kernels and simplifies implementation with a query blurring method, achieving notable improvements in quality and reducing side effects.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Context & Problem**: Diffusion models face challenges in producing detailed and coherent images due to the difficulty in managing the variance of attention weights and the energy landscape's complexity. Efficiently smoothing the energy function can enhance image quality and model performance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Methodology**: The paper investigates the impact of Gaussian blur on attention weights to enhance diffusion guidance. The approach is outlined as follows:
   - **MEffect of Gaussian Blur**: The paper theoretically analyzes how Gaussian blur influences attention weights. It demonstrates that Gaussian blur preserves the mean of attention weights, reduces their variance, and consequently decreases the log-sum-exp (lse) value. These properties are essential for understanding the effect of blur on the underlying energy function.
   - **Attenuating Energy Curvature**: The paper shows that applying Gaussian blur to attention weights attenuates the curvature of the energy landscape. This attenuation leads to a smoother, blunter prediction, which enhances the performance of guidance mechanisms.
   - **Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG)**: Building on these findings, the paper introduces Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG). SEG utilizes the attenuated energy landscape to improve diffusion guidance. Additionally, an equivalent query blurring method is proposed, which performs attention blurring efficiently without incurring quadratic complexity in relation to the number of tokens.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Key Findings**: 
   - **Improved Image Quality**: SEG enhances image sharpness and coherence by smoothing the energy landscape, leading to finer details and more realistic textures.
   - **Consistency in Results**: The approach stabilizes attention weights, reducing variability and improving the reliability of image generation.
   - **Enhanced Performance**: SEG outperforms existing methods, such as vanilla diffusion models and other guidance techniques, in generating images with better overall composition and adherence to prompts.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Conclusion & Future Challenges**: SEG represents a significant advancement in refining diffusion models. Future research should focus on exploring SEG's application across different types of attention mechanisms and image generation tasks to fully realize its potential and address any limitations. SEG provides a substantial enhancement in diffusion model performance, demonstrating how refined energy management techniques can significantly improve the quality and stability of AI-generated images.
