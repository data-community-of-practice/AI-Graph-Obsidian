Decoding Cyclone Biparjoy: How Image Processing Unveils Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Patterns

üìå Tropical cyclones pose a significant threat to coastal regions, with their associated rainfall contributing substantially to annual precipitation in affected areas. However, accurately predicting the amount and distribution of cyclone-induced rainfall remains a challenge. This paper presents a new method using satellite imagery and image processing techniques to estimate the area and precipitation associated with Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy, offering valuable insights for disaster management and climate research.

üîπ Tropical cyclones, like Biparjoy, significantly impact annual rainfall patterns in India, yet quantifying their precipitation remains a challenge. Traditional methods, such as manual observations, radar, and numerical weather prediction models, have limitations in accuracy and coverage, especially over oceanic areas. This gap in precise rainfall estimation hinders effective disaster preparedness and management. Moreover, the dynamic nature of cyclones makes it difficult to predict the amount and spatial distribution of rainfall, leaving vulnerable areas at risk.

üîπ This study introduces a novel approach to quantifying cyclone-related rainfall using image processing on satellite data. Utilizing the GPM satellite's IMERG-Late Run product, researchers developed a method combining spatial subsetting, masking, and Connected Component Analysis to isolate cyclone-induced rainfall patterns. This innovative methodology enables precise estimation of total rainfall and affected area, especially valuable in regions with limited ground-based observations.

üîπ The study revealed Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy's significant impact, with 53.14 mm/day average rainfall over 411.76 thousand square kilometers. Four states were primarily affected, with Rajasthan recording a peak 42.89 mm/day. These findings highlight the cyclone's extensive reach and variability, crucial for improving forecasting and disaster management.

üîπ This study advances cyclone-related precipitation analysis with a novel quantification approach. Despite challenges with satellite imagery, the method promises improved understanding of extreme weather. Future research should integrate this approach with other data sources across various cyclones, potentially enhancing region-specific disaster preparedness strategies, crucial given climate change impacts on cyclones.
