# TurboEdit: Text-Based Image Editing Using Few-Step Diffusion Models

In the quest for faster and more effective image editing, this paper tackles the challenge of adapting diffusion models to achieve high-quality results with minimal steps. The authors introduce a refined approach that enhances the "edit-friendly" DDPM noise inversion method, addressing common issues like visual artifacts and weak editing strength. By introducing a shifted noise schedule and a pseudo-guidance scale, this approach enables effective text-based image editing in as few as three diffusion steps, accelerating the process while preserving or enhancing image quality.

1️⃣ **Context and Problem Statement**: The paper identifies critical limitations in existing diffusion models for image editing, particularly the generation of visual artifacts and insufficient editing strength when adapting to few-step diffusion methods.

2️⃣ **Novel Methodology:** 
   - **Treating Visual Artifacts:** It identifies that applying DDPM noise-inversion to SDXL-Turbo resulted in visual artifacts due to mismatched noise dynamics. To address this, the paper realigned the denoising timestep by injecting a larger timestep into the model, synchronizing noise statistics. Additionally, it clipped the final noise correction to avoid introducing new artifacts.
   - **Improving Prompt Alignment:** It tackled the issue of insufficient editing strength by modifying the inference formula to incorporate a pseudo-guidance scale. This adjustment enhanced the effect of prompt changes by improving the alignment between new and original prompts, resulting in stronger image edits.
   - **Connecting EF and DDS:** It demonstrated that edit-friendly inversion and DDS share a similar structure by shifting images between predictions with different prompts. It established that these methods are functionally equivalent under specific conditions, highlighting their methodological similarities.
   
3️⃣ **Key Findings:**
   - **Reduction of Visual Artifacts:** The approach realigns the denoising timestep schedule, reducing visual artifacts and improving image quality.
   - **Improved Editing Strength:** Enhanced prompt alignment through pseudo-guidance leads to more effective and pronounced editing changes.
   - **Connection Between Methods:** The paper establishes that the edit-friendly (EF) inversion method and Delta Denoising Score (DDS) are functionally equivalent under specific conditions, confirming the theoretical underpinnings of the approach.
   - **Efficient Implementation:** The refined method significantly reduces the number of required editing steps, enhancing processing efficiency while maintaining high image quality.

## Conclusion and Future Challenges

This paper provides a substantial advancement in few-step image editing by improving noise inversion and prompt alignment techniques. The proposed method effectively reduces artifacts and strengthens edits, offering a faster and higher-quality editing process. Future research could explore adaptive denoising schedules for varied editing scenarios and investigate the integration of these techniques with other advanced models. Additionally, applying these improvements to fields like video editing or real-time applications could further expand their utility and impact.
