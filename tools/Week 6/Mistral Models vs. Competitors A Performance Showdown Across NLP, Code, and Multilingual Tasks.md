<div align="center"><small>Performance Comparison: Mistral 7B vs. LLaMA Models, Retrieved from Mistral AI Website</small></div><br>


The second figure provides a more aggregated view of the models' performance across broader categories such as MMLU, Knowledge, Reasoning, Comprehension, AGI Eval, Math, BBH, and Code. Mistral 7B consistently outperforms or matches the performance of larger models like LLaMA 2 13B and LLaMA 1 34B in several categories, indicating its efficiency and effectiveness despite having fewer parameters. These results highlight Mistral 7B's strong capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks and its potential as a preferred choice for various applications due to its balanced performance and efficiency.

### Example

From the figures above, we can see that Mistral 7B significantly outperforms the LLaMA series models in solving math problems. To illustrate this further, we present a real-world math problem and compare the answers generated by the LLaMA 2 8B model and the Mistral 7B model. This comparison will help us explore the differences in their performance and reasoning capabilities when tackling mathematical challenges.

**Question: A train leaves New York traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. Another train leaves Chicago traveling at a constant speed of 80 miles per hour, heading towards New York. They are 1,600 miles apart. How many hours will it take for the two trains to meet?**

<div align="center"><small>Screenshot of the Answer from Terminal</small></div>

**Answer from Mistral 7B:**

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian/img/MistralExtention-6.png)<div align="center"><small>Screenshot of the Answer from Terminal</small></div>

The response from the LLaMA 2 7B model demonstrates a highly disorganized mathematical logic, with many of the equations used being entirely nonsensical and leading to an incorrect answer. In contrast, the Mistral 7B model provides a much shorter response, but its logic is very clear, and the answer is entirely accurate. This highlights the superior ability of Mistral 7B to reason through mathematical problems in a more coherent and effective manner.

## Mistral NeMo: Performance Benchmarks and Real-World Examples

### Benchmarks 1

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian/img/MistralExtention-7.png)
<div align="center"><small>Performance Comparison, Retrieved from Mistral AI Website</small></div><br>


The table shows that Mistral NeMo 12B outperforms other models, such as Gemma 2 9B and LLaMA 3 8B, across various benchmarks, including common sense reasoning (HellaSwag: 83.5%), question answering (TriviaQA: 73.8%), and advanced knowledge (CommonSenseQA: 70.4%). With a much larger context window (128k vs. 8k), Mistral NeMo 12B handles complex tasks more effectively, providing clearer and more accurate responses, making it a superior choice for diverse NLP applications.

### Example 1

While it is evident that Mistral NeMo often outperforms other competing models in many benchmarks, the differences in scores are not always substantial. This means that, in most cases, the output quality between the models is quite similar. However, there are certain instances where a noticeable difference in quality can be observed. Here is an example:

**Question: Explain the concept of "photosynthesis" in one or two simple sentences, using an analogy to make it easier to understand.**

**Answer from LLaMA 3 8B:**

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian/img/MistralExtention-8.png)
<div align="center"><small>Screenshot of the Answer from Terminal</small></div>

**Answer from Mistral NeMo:**

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian/img/MistralExtention-9.png)
<div align="center"><small>Screenshot of the Answer from Terminal</small></div><br>

When asked to explain "photosynthesis" using an analogy, LLaMA 3 and Mistral NeMo provide noticeably different responses. LLaMA 3's analogy, comparing photosynthesis to a bakery using yeast to rise dough, is confusing and misleading because it inaccurately equates sunlight with yeast and suggests processes that are fundamentally different. This can easily confuse users. In contrast, Mistral NeMo compares photosynthesis to a plant "making its own breakfast," using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. This analogy is simple and accurate, making the concept easy to understand. Creating effective analogies is more challenging than straightforward explanations, and Mistral NeMo demonstrates a better ability to convey complex ideas clearly.

<div align="center"><small>Tekken Compression Rate, Retrieved from Mistral AI Website</small></div><br>

The first chart shows that Mistral NeMo 12B consistently outperforms LLaMA 3 8B across various languages in tasks involving common sense reasoning (HellaSwag), scientific reasoning (Arc Challenge), and multitask knowledge evaluation (MMLU). This highlights Mistral NeMo's superior multilingual capabilities. The second chart further supports this by illustrating Mistral NeMo's effective compression ratio across different languages, maintaining a low ratio for many, indicating efficient processing and understanding. These results demonstrate Mistral NeMo's strong ability to handle diverse languages effectively.

### Example 2

Referring to the second chart (Tekken Compression Rate), which shows languages arranged from left to right based on decreasing model proficiency, we chose Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese—three languages where the model's performance varies. We asked the same train collision problem in these three languages to see how well Mistral NeMo handles multilingual tasks. This approach allows us to explore Mistral NeMo's practical performance in multilingual processing.

**Answer in Chinese:**
