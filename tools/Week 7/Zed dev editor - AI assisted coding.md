## The Birth of Zed AI

Zed is more than just a code editor. Founded by Nathan Sobo, the former lead developer of Atom, Zed aims to create a more connected and intelligent coding environment. In collaboration with Anthropic, Zed AI integrates Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a state-of-the-art language model, to redefine AI-assisted coding.

## 0: The Current Challenge

VSCode has become the go-to editor for anyone starting in programming, standing out as the most popular IDE. It's modern, sleek, packed with features, and highly capable. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s easy for developers to extend, and it boasts a vast library of extensions for customizing behavior, changing themes, and adding support for numerous languages and frameworks.

However, VSCode has a significant drawback: its performance is sluggish.

As mentioned, VSCode leverages web technologies and runs on Electron.js, a framework for creating cross-platform desktop applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While Electron is widely used and powerful, it often suffers from slowness, lag, and high memory usage, leading to the rise of more efficient alternatives like Tauri.

Due to these performance concerns, new, faster, and more memory-efficient options are emerging, with Zed being one of the most notable contenders recently.

## 1: The New IDE - Zed

Zed, created by the team behind Atom and Tree-sitter, aspires to replace VSCode as the leading code editor.

The developers of Zed, who also created Atom, are the same ones responsible for Electron.js—formerly Atom Shell— which contributes to VSCode's performance challenges.

Recently open-sourced, Zed comes packed with powerful features, including:

### Exceptional Speed  
Zed has demonstrated the ability to outpace lightweight editors like Sublime Text, performing nearly twice as fast as VSCode, as evidenced by benchmarks from Zed Industries. 

The impressive speed of Zed can be attributed to two key factors:

1. **Built with Rust** and utilizing a specialized framework called GPUI, Zed harnesses GPU capabilities for enhanced speed and reliability.
2. **Efficient Multithreading**: Zed employs multithreading and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to effectively utilize multiple cores, enhancing performance.

Zed can outperform lightweight editors like Sublime Text as shown in this benchmark, and performs nearly twice as fast as VSCode:
