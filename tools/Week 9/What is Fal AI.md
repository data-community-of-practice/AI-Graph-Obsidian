3. Create a Python script (e.g., flux_dev_fal.py) with the following code:
```python
import fal_client
import time
from PIL import Image
import requests
from io import BytesIO

# Submit a request to the FLUX.1 [dev] model
start_time = time.time()

handler = fal_client.submit(
    "fal-ai/flux/dev",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "A serene lake surrounded by autumn trees at sunset",
        "image_size": {
            "width": 1024,
            "height": 1024
        },
        "num_inference_steps": 28,
        "guidance_scale": 3.5,
        "num_images": 1,
        "enable_safety_checker": True
    },
)

# Get the result
result = handler.get()
print(result)

# Calculate and print the generation time
generation_time = time.time() - start_time
print(f"Image generated in {generation_time:.2f} seconds")

# Save the generated image
image_url = result['images'][0]['url']
response = requests.get(image_url)
img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
img.save("generated_image.png")
print("Image saved as generated_image.png")
```
4. Run the script:
```python
python flux_dev_fal.py
```
5. The script will output the result, including the URL of the generated image, the generation time (2.76 seconds inference time), and save the image locally.

<div align="center"><small style="font-size: 16px;">Real Time Stable Diffusion Inference by Fal</small></div>


Fal AI's real-time functionality, as demonstrated in this application, leverages advanced techniques to provide near-instantaneous image generation. Here's how the real-time system works:
- WebSocket Connection: The `fal.realtime` client establishes a persistent WebSocket connection between the user's browser and Fal AI's servers. This connection allows for continuous, bidirectional communication, which is crucial for real-time interactions.
- Streaming Inference: Unlike traditional API calls where the entire process must complete before sending a response, Fal AI uses a streaming inference approach. This means the AI model can start sending partial results as soon as they're available, rather than waiting for the entire image to be generated.
- Efficient State Management: The `fal.realtime` client manages the state of the generation process, handling updates smoothly without requiring the entire page to reload or the connection to be re-established for each change.

This real-time capability opens up new possibilities for interactive AI applications, enabling experiences that feel more like natural, instantaneous interactions rather than discrete query-and-response cycles. Developers can leverage this technology to create highly responsive AI-powered tools for a wide range of applications, from creative design assistants to dynamic content generation systems.

## Working Example 4: Deploying a Custom AI Model (Currently Beta Test Only)
Fal AI allows developers to deploy custom AI models using serverless functions (An **Admin API Key** is required to access this feature). This approach enables you to run your own models in a scalable, cloud-based environment. In this example, we'll deploy a simple custom image classification model using PyTorch and demonstrate how to use it through Fal AI's API.

Steps:
1. Set up your environment: Install the fal library `pip install fal`
2. Create a new Python file (e.g., `custom_sd_model.py`) with the following code:
```python
import fal
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fal.toolkit import Image

class Input(BaseModel):
    prompt: str

class Output(BaseModel):
    image: Image

class CustomSDModel(fal.App, keep_alive=300):
    machine_type = "GPU-A100"
    requirements = [
        "diffusers==0.28.0",
        "torch==2.3.0",
        "accelerate",
        "transformers",
    ]

    def setup(self):
        import torch
        from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline, DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler
        
        self.pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
            "sd-community/sdxl-flash",
            torch_dtype=torch.float16,
        ).to("cuda")
        
        self.pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler.from_config(
            self.pipe.scheduler.config,
            timestep_spacing="trailing",
        )

    @fal.endpoint("/")
    def generate(self, request: Input) -> Output:
        result = self.pipe(request.prompt, num_inference_steps=7, guidance_scale=3)
        image = Image.from_pil(result.images[0])
        return Output(image=image)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fal.run(CustomSDModel)
```
3. Deploy your model:
```python
fal deploy custom_sd_model.py::CustomSDModel
```
4. After deployment, Fal AI will provide you with an API endpoint. You can use this endpoint to generate images:
```python
import requests

API_URL = "https://fal.run/your-user-id/custom-sd-model"  # Replace with your actual URL
API_KEY = "your_fal_api_key"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Key {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "prompt": "A serene lake surrounded by autumn trees at sunset"
}

response = requests.post(API_URL, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

This example demonstrates deploying a custom Stable Diffusion model as a Fal AI private serverless function. The `CustomSDModel` class, inheriting from `fal.App`, is configured to run on a GPU-A100 with specific Python package requirements. It utilizes a `setup()` method for model initialization, implements a `keep_alive` feature to reduce cold starts, and exposes an API endpoint via the `@fal.endpoint("/")` decorator. The model is deployed using a simple fal deploy command, leveraging Fal AI's GPU infrastructure.

By using Fal AI, developers gain access to scalable GPU resources without managing hardware. This approach simplifies deployment, offers automatic scaling, and integrates with Fal AI's monitoring tools. It enables efficient deployment of custom AI models like Stable Diffusion, combining the power of sophisticated AI with the convenience of cloud-based services.

## Comparison with Alternatives
Fal AI distinguishes itself from traditional cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure by offering a more streamlined, AI-focused platform. While these larger providers offer extensive customization and a broader range of services, Fal AI provides a more specialized, user-friendly experience tailored specifically for AI model deployment. Unlike platforms such as Hugging Face, which primarily focus on model sharing and collaboration, Fal AI emphasizes rapid deployment and scalable inference. This makes Fal AI particularly suitable for developers who need to quickly operationalize AI models without deep infrastructure expertise.

Compared to other AI-specific platforms like Replicate or Banana, Fal AI stands out with its real-time capabilities and optimized performance for certain models. Fal AI's approach to serverless deployment is similar to services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, but with a specific focus on AI workloads and pre-optimized environments for popular AI frameworks. This specialization allows for faster deployment times and potentially better performance for AI tasks. However, it's worth noting that Fal AI may offer less flexibility for non-AI workloads compared to more general-purpose cloud platforms.

## Conclusion
Fal AI offers a compelling solution for developers seeking to deploy AI models, particularly for real-time applications. Its streamlined approach simplifies the deployment process, provides optimized performance for AI workloads, and offers scalable infrastructure without the complexity of managing traditional cloud resources. While it may not match the breadth of services offered by major cloud providers, Fal AI's focus on AI-specific needs makes it an attractive option for teams looking to quickly operationalize their models. As AI continues to evolve, platforms like Fal AI are poised to play a crucial role in democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities, enabling developers to bring innovative AI-powered applications to market more efficiently.
