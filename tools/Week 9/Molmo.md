## Introduction: What is Molmo AI?

Molmo AI on PixMo Dataset is a state-of-the-art, open-source multimodal model developed by the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2). Designed to rival proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude, Molmo offers powerful image and text comprehension capabilities at a fraction of the cost and complexity of its competitors. This revolutionary model is not only accessible and free but also showcases that open-source AI can match or even surpass closed, proprietary solutions in key benchmarks.

Molmo's strengths lie in its ability to understand, process, and generate insights from both text and visual data, making it an ideal choice for a variety of applications, from AI-powered web agents to complex robotics systems. It has four modals- Molmo-72B, Molmo-7B-D, Molmo-7B-o, MolmoE-1B.

## Highlights of Molmo AI

1. **Multimodal Understanding**  
   Molmo stands out for its ability to handle both textual and visual data within a single model. It can interpret images with remarkable accuracy, recognizing objects, reading charts, and even interacting with user interface (UI) elements. This makes Molmo highly valuable for tasks such as automating web navigation, performing complex data analysis, and developing AI systems that can "see" and understand their environment.

2. **Efficient Data Utilisation**  
   Unlike large proprietary models that often rely on vast amounts of training data, Molmo is trained on a carefully curated dataset of just 600,000 images. This ensures high-quality, conversational descriptions while keeping the model efficient and faster to train. As a result, Molmo AI can perform complex tasks like object counting and emotional recognition with precision, even on smaller datasets.

3. **Open-Source Flexibility**  
   One of the most significant advantages of Molmo AI is its open-source nature. Developers and researchers can access the model weights, code, and training data freely, which promotes innovation across industries. This transparency is a game-changer, allowing users to customize the model for specific use cases without the financial or technical constraints typically associated with proprietary AI solutions.

4. **Low Resource Requirements**  
   Molmo AI is designed to be efficient, running on relatively low-powered hardware without sacrificing performance. While proprietary models often demand vast computational resources, Molmo's optimized architecture allows even the smaller 1B model to perform effectively on typical devices, making advanced AI accessible to a broader audience.

## Key Features and Capabilities
Molmo specializes in visual understanding, demonstrating impressive real-time image analysis capabilities. Its open-source nature allows for greater transparency and customisation compared to closed proprietary models2.

Molmo potential capabilities in the below domains:
1. Computer vision tasks

## How Molmo Compares to Other AI Models

Molmo AI competes directly with leading closed-source models like GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5. While many proprietary models boast superior performance due to their vast datasets, Molmo's streamlined and highly efficient data utilization enables it to achieve similar outcomes with a fraction of the data. Furthermore, its open-source framework encourages community-driven improvements, ensuring that the model continues to evolve and stay competitive.

In benchmarks, Molmo has outperformed several commercial models on tasks involving both image and text comprehension, proving that an open-source approach can be just as powerful and cost-effective. The 72B parameter version of Molmo AI is particularly noteworthy for its ability to handle complex visual and language tasks, delivering results that match or even exceed those of its commercial counterparts. This is the most open vision language model. Among it, Molmo-7B-O model is the most open model.

MolmoE-1B, based on the OLMoE-1B-7B mixture-of-experts LLM, nearly matches the performance of GPT-4V on both academic benchmarks and user preference. Molmo-7B-O and Molmo-7B-D, based on OLMo-7B and Qwen2 7B, respectively, perform comfortably between GPT-4V and GPT-4o on both academic benchmarks and user preference. Our best-in-class
Molmo-72B model, based on Qwen2 72B, achieves the highest academic benchmark score and ranks second by human preference, just behind GPT-4o. Our best model outperforms many state-of-the-art proprietary systems, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
