In recent times, there has been a boom in the field of image generation, with models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E leading the charge. Gone are the days when people had to struggle to find high-quality, non-copyrighted images. Now, you can simply provide a description of the image you wish to generate through a prompt to a generative model and receive realistic, high-definition images in return. In this article, we will explore how you can easily create images using the OpenAI API.

### Step 1 : Create an OpenAI API Key

- You first need to create an OpenAI account in order to get access to the creation of API keys.

- One you create an OpenAI account, navigate to the "User API Keys" section by clicking on "Your Profile" on the OpenAI site.

- Create an API key and make sure you store it somewhere as we would be requiring it soon.

### Step 2: Python Implementation

- Firstly, the python implementation of DALL-E requires the installation of the "requests" module. Hence, navigate to your terminal and
  '''bash
  pip install requests
  '''
