<div align="center"><small>ChatGPT-4o answer</small></div>

When it comes to complex questions, GPT-4o Mini doesn't perform as well as GPT-4o. From this example, we can also see that the story generated by GPT-4o Mini lacks logical coherence, with many parts that don't make sense. GPT-4o is likely to create a more intricate story with deeper character development, a more sophisticated plot twist, and richer, more vivid descriptions. While GPT-4o Mini is still capable of generating a good story, it might simplify character development, deliver a less surprising plot twist, and use less detailed or nuanced descriptive language.

## Conclusion
