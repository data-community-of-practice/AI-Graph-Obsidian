## Vision models

As the first Llama models capable of handling vision tasks, the 11B and 90B models required a new architecture designed to support image reasoning.

To enable image input, adapter weights were trained to integrate a pre-trained image encoder with the pre-trained language model. The adapter uses cross-attention layers to feed the image encoder's representations into the language model. These adapters were trained on text-image pairs to align the image and text representations. While training the adapters, the image encoder parameters were updated, but the language model's parameters remained unchanged to preserve its text-only capabilities, making it a seamless replacement for Llama 3.1 models.

The training process followed multiple stages, starting with pretrained Llama 3.1 text models. First, image adapters and encoders were added and pretrained on large-scale noisy image-text pairs. Then, the models were trained on medium-scale, high-quality, domain-specific, and knowledge-enhanced image-text pairs.

For post-training, a similar approach to the text models was used, involving alignment through supervised fine-tuning, rejection sampling, and direct preference optimization. Synthetic data generation played a key role, with the Llama 3.1 model filtering and augmenting questions and answers based on in-domain images. A reward model was employed to rank candidate answers for fine-tuning data. Additionally, safety mitigation data was incorporated to ensure the model maintained a high level of safety while remaining helpful.

The final result is a set of models that can process both image and text prompts, allowing for a deeper understanding and reasoning of the two combined inputs. This marks another step in enhancing Llama models with more advanced capabilities.

## Lightweight models

As we talked about with Llama 3.1, powerful teacher models can be utilized to create smaller models with enhanced performance. The team applied two techniques—pruning and distillation—to the 1B and 3B models, making them the first highly capable, lightweight Llama models that can efficiently run on devices.

Pruning helped reduce the size of existing Llama models while retaining as much knowledge and performance as possible. For the 1B and 3B models, structured pruning was applied in a single-shot process from the Llama 3.1 8B model. This involved systematically removing parts of the network and adjusting weights and gradients to create a smaller, more efficient model that still maintained the original performance.

Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one, allowing the smaller model to achieve better performance than training from scratch. For the 1B and 3B models in Llama 3.2, logits from the Llama 3.1 8B and 70B models were incorporated during the pre-training stage, where outputs (logits) from the larger models were used as token-level targets. After pruning, knowledge distillation was applied to further recover and improve the model's performance.

## Benchmarks

while the instruct models were evaluated across three popular benchmarks that measure instruction-following and correlate well with the LMSYS Chatbot Arena: IFEval, AlpacaEval, and MixEval-Hard. These are the results for the base models, with Llama-3.1-8B included as a reference:

Remarkably, the 3B model is as strong as the 8B one on IFEval! This makes the model well-suited for agentic applications, where following instructions is crucial for improving reliability. This high IFEval score is very impressive for a model of this size.



## How to Download and Run Llama 3.2 Locally 

For this project, we are using Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model on Mac.

### Llama.cpp & Llama-cpp-python

**Llama.cpp** is the go-to framework for all things cross-platform on-device ML inference. Meta provides quantized **4-bit** and **8-bit** weights for both the **1B** and **3B** models in this collection. The community is encouraged to embrace these models and create additional **quantizations** and **fine-tunes**. You can find all the quantized **Llama 3.2** models [here](https://huggingface.co).

## Installing Llama.cpp
