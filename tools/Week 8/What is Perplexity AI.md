### Deep Dive Research: Using Threads and Focus Modes
Perplexity AI offers advanced features for users who need to conduct in-depth research on complex topics. Two key features that facilitate this are Threads and Focus Modes. Threads allow users to maintain context throughout a conversation, enabling a series of related questions without losing the original context. Focus Modes, on the other hand, allow users to target specific types of sources, such as academic papers, social media, or video content. Together, these features transform Perplexity AI from a simple question-answering tool into a powerful research assistant capable of deep, multifaceted exploration of topics.
Let's explore an example question to demonstrate how to search within a specific field:
```javascript
I need to research the impact of AI on job markets for my economics paper
```
