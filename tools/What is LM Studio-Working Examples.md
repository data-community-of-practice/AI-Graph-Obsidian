## Working Example 1: Chat with a Local LLM
Now that you have LM Studio installed, let's walk through the process of chatting with a local large language model. This example will demonstrate how to download a model, load it into memory, and engage in a conversation. We'll use ``Phi 3 mini 4k Instruct`` as our example model, but the process is similar for other models available in LM Studio.
1. Download the Model: 
   - Navigate to the Discover tab in LM Studio
   - Search for "Phi 3 mini 4k Instruct" in the search bar
   - Click the download button and wait for the process to complete

<div align="center"><small style="font-size: 16px;">Open the Model Downloads tab at the bottom to view the download progress</small></div><br>

2. Load the Model:
   - Switch to the Chat tab
   - Click on the model loader button (usually at the top of the interface)
   - Select the downloaded Hermes 2 Pro Mistral 7B model from the list
   - Wait for the model to load into memory (this may take a few moments)

<div align="center"><small style="font-size: 16px;">Choose the Downloaded Model from the dropdown menu in the Chat Tab</small></div><br>

3. Start Your Chat:
- Once loaded, you'll see the chat interface
- Type your first message, e.g., "Hello, What model are you using?"
- Press enter and wait for the model's response
- Continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions

One of LM Studio's standout features is its transparent display of inference metrics after each model response. As shown in the image, these metrics include time to first token, generation time, generation speed (tokens per second), stop reason, GPU layers used, CPU threads, whether memory-efficient inference (mlock) is enabled, and token count. This real-time feedback is invaluable for users looking to optimize model performance or understand the underlying processes. For instance, you can see how different settings affect generation speed or how close you are to the context limit. This level of insight is rarely available in cloud-based AI services, making LM Studio an excellent tool for both learning about and fine-tuning LLM performance.

## Working Example 2: Harnessing Multi Model Sessions
LM Studio's Multi Model Sessions feature enables users to load and interact with multiple language models simultaneously, each with custom settings. This powerful capability allows for direct comparison of model outputs, efficient experimentation, and the creation of ensemble systems. Users can access these models via API or the Multi-Model Prompt UI, providing a unique environment for in-depth LLM analysis and leveraging the strengths of various models in a single session.

1. Accessing Multi Model Sessions:
   - Navigate to the Playground tab in LM Studio
   - Look for the "Multi Model Sessions" section
2. Setting Up Models:
   - Click on "Select Models to Load" to select your first model
   - Choose the model from your downloaded list
   - Configure custom settings for the model (e.g., context length, GPU usage)
   - Repeat this process to add additional models

<div align="center"><small style="font-size: 16px;">Configure the simultaneous loading of multiple models into system memory</small></div><br>

3. Using the Multi-Model Prompt UI:
   - After models are loaded, access the Multi-Model Prompt UI
   - Enter a prompt that you want to test across all loaded models
   - Submit the prompt and observe the responses from each model

Multi Model Sessions in LM Studio offer a powerful suite of features designed for advanced LLM experimentation and comparison. This functionality allows for custom configurations per model, enabling performance optimization tailored to each LLM's characteristics. The integrated API access facilitates programmatic interaction with multiple loaded models, while built-in resource management, including guardrails, ensures system stability. The Multi-Model Prompt UI enables real-time output comparison across different LLMs, and the session's flexibility accommodates various model types, from instruction-tuned to base models, all within a single, efficient workspace.

## Working Example 3: Using LM Studio as a Local API Server
LM Studio's local API server functionality transforms your personal computer into a powerful AI backend, offering OpenAI-compatible endpoints for seamless integration with existing tools and workflows. This feature enables developers to leverage local LLMs in their applications, providing greater control over data privacy, reduced latency, and cost-effective AI solutions without relying on cloud services.

1. Start the LM Studio Server:
   - Navigate to the Developer tab in LM Studio
   - Locate the "Local Server" section
   - Load a downloaded model
   - Click "Start Server" and note the port number (typically 1234)

<div align="center"><small style="font-size: 16px;">Initialize Model and Launch Server</small></div>

2. Prepare Your API Client:
   - Open Postman or your preferred API testing tool
   - Set up a new request with the base URL: http://localhost:1234

3. Make an API Request:
   - Choose an endpoint (e.g., /v1/chat/completions)
   - Set the request method to POST
   - Add headers: Content-Type: application/json and Authorization: Bearer lm-studio
   - In the request body, specify the model and your prompt:
```python
{
  "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself."}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

<div align="center"><small style="font-size: 16px;">Evaluate the /v1/chat/completion endpoint with Postman</small></div>

4. Explore Other Endpoints:
   - Test /v1/models (GET) to list available models
   - Use /v1/completions for text completion tasks
   - Try /v1/embeddings to generate text embeddings

5. Integrate with Your Application:
   - Update your existing code that uses OpenAI's API to point to your local server
   - Adjust the base URL to http://localhost:1234
   - Use your loaded model's name instead of OpenAI model names
```python
# Example: reuse your existing OpenAI setup
from openai import OpenAI

# Point to the local server
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="lm-studio")

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself."}
  ],
  temperature=0.7,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

LM Studio's local API server provides a robust platform for AI development and experimentation, offering OpenAI-compatible endpoints that support chat completions, text completions, and embeddings generation. This functionality allows developers to seamlessly transition from cloud-based services to local LLMs, enabling enhanced privacy, reduced costs, and greater flexibility in model selection and customization. By exposing these capabilities through familiar API protocols, LM Studio bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and practical application development, empowering users to build sophisticated AI-driven solutions entirely on their local machines.


## Advanced Features and Customization
LM Studio offers a range of advanced features for power users and developers. Config presets allow you to save and quickly apply custom configurations for different use cases, streamlining your workflow when switching between tasks or models. These presets can include system prompts, inference parameters, and other settings, enabling you to fine-tune your LLM interactions with precision. Customizing prompt templates provides even greater control over model behavior, allowing you to tailor the input format to specific models or tasks, potentially improving the quality and relevance of generated responses.

For those seeking automation and scripting capabilities, LM Studio provides a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool called 'lms'. This tool enables users to perform a variety of operations from the terminal, including starting and stopping the LM Studio server, loading and unloading models, and even running inferences. The 'lms' CLI is particularly useful for integrating LM Studio into larger workflows or automated pipelines, making it an invaluable asset for developers looking to incorporate local LLM capabilities into their projects or research endeavors.
