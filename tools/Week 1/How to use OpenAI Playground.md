OpenAI has created a tool/platform for adventurous souls who want to do more than just ask ChatGPT to complete questions on their online MCQ quizzes. "Playground" allows users to alter the parameters (i.e., settings) of GPT models through an interactive environment. This tool can be very powerful; through trial and error, users can figure out the set of parameters that provide the best results for their use case, rather than using the default parameters on the chat engine provided by OpenAI (ChatGPT) and gaining merely satisfactory results. 

Let us now dive straight into understanding this tool!
