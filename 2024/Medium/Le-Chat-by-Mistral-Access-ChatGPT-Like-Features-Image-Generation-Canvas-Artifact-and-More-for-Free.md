## Main Content

Mistral AI has introduced new features to its Le Chat platform, including Canvas, internet search, and PDF uploads, all mirroring ChatGPT's capabilities—and they are **completely free!**

Now, you can access the features of three major AI models all in one place.

They also announced a partnership with the renowned image generation model Flux, offering online image creation capabilities on the Le Chat platform, again at no cost.

Mistral's CEO, Arthur Mensch, stated that the new version of Le Chat is a milestone, marking the platform as a "more mature animal.”

## **ChatGPT-Like Features Available for Free**

On Mistral's official platform, Le Chat (which may sound like "chat" but actually means "cat" in French), a new series of ChatGPT-like features have been launched for free.

According to a table released by Mistral, aside from o1 and voice conversations, most other features are included.

This also encompasses OpenAI's newly launched advanced interface, Canvas, which is currently exclusive to ChatGPT subscribers.

- Access to latest frontier model
- Web search with citations
- Canvas for ideation, in-line editing, and export
- Image generation
- Image/document analysis
- Task agents
- Single platform from models to outputs

In Le Chat's Canvas, generated documents can be displayed separately, eliminating the need to manually extract them from conversations.

Code can also be handled in the same way, with support for real-time previews and the ability to select specific sections for modification.

Next is the internet search capability. Like ChatGPT, Le Chat can perform online searches to summarize information and provide source citations, all at a very fast speed.

Additionally, the current version of Le Chat can process complex PDF documents and images, performing analysis and summarization of tables, charts, text, formulas, equations, and more.

In the following example, Le Chat extracted information, summarized, and semantically understood the famous quantum entanglement paper written by Einstein and others in 1935.

In addition to image analysis, the latest version of Le Chat also supports text-to-image generation. However, Mistral has not developed these models independently and has instead partnered with Flux to integrate their models.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202411201556433.png)

It is also possible to create and @Agent in conversations to intelligently perform certain tasks, but currently, the creation page is only available in French.

However, the models released by Mistral so far have not extended to voice modalities, so Le Chat does not have the advanced voice interaction features available in ChatGPT. Additionally, there is no desktop client.

Therefore, although Mistral's efforts are seen as an attempt to catch up with ChatGPT in terms of features, there is still some distance to go before they truly match it. However, Mistral does have the advantage of being free.

## **Open-Source Multimodal Model: Pixtral Large**

Pixtral Large can be used for research and educational purposes under the Mistral Research License (MRL), and for experimental, testing, and production purposes in commercial settings under the Mistral Commercial License.

Pixtral Large is an evolution of Mistral Large 2, released in the summer of 2024, and the first multimodal model Pixtral 12-B, released in September. Regarding the expansion of the multimodal model to 124 billion parameters, Mistral AI's CEO stated: "We increasingly recognize that creating the best AI experience requires co-designing the model and the product interface. Pixtral was trained with high-impact front-end applications in mind, making it a great example."

Pixtral Large includes a 123 billion parameter decoder and a 1 billion parameter visual encoder, excelling in both text and visual data processing.

With a context window of 128K, Pixtral Large can handle at least 30 high-resolution images or approximately a 300-page book, comparable to the capabilities of leading models in the OpenAI GPT series.

In terms of performance, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, including MathVista, DocVQA, and VQAv2, making it highly suitable for tasks such as chart interpretation, document analysis, and image understanding.

Specifically, on the MathVista benchmark, Pixtral Large achieved an accuracy of 69.4%, outperforming all other models. In the ChartQA and DocVQA benchmarks, Pixtral Large surpassed GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro.

Pixtral Large also demonstrated strong competitiveness on the MM-MT-Bench, outperforming Claude-3.5 Sonnet (the new version), Gemini-1.5 Pro, and GPT-4o (the latest version).

In terms of image understanding, Pixtral Large also performs exceptionally well. For instance, when you upload a bill and ask the model, "I bought coffee and sausage, plus an 18% tip. How much should I pay?" it can accurately calculate the total amount.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202411201557131.png)

Pixtral Large will provide the total amount in an organized manner, first calculating the cost of the coffee and sausage—such as two lattes and one sausage—then computing the 18% tip, and finally providing the total amount.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202411201607426.png)

Pixtral Large can also accurately understand and analyze charts. For instance, when asked about the point at which the "dark dragon" model starts experiencing issues based on a training loss curve, Pixtral Large accurately analyzes: "At 10,000 steps, the training loss begins to show instability... Subsequently, this instability persists, with another significant peak occurring around 20,000 steps..."

In the next example, when you upload an image and ask Pixtral Large which companies use Mistral AI models, it can provide an accurate response based on the information presented in the image.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202411201557924.webp)

Pixtral Large can provide accurate results based on the information in the image, and its response process is as follows.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/data-community-of-practice/AI-Graph-Obsidian@main/img/202411201557132.webp)

However, on Reddit, some have questioned whether Pixtral truly achieves state-of-the-art performance. They point out that Mistral's official comparisons were limited to a few models, **including only the open-source Llama-3.2 90B**.

In reality, on multiple datasets, Qwen2-VL (with a maximum parameter size of 72B) performs better than Pixtral. Additionally, on certain datasets, Pixtral's test scores are also lower than those of Molmo, developed by a non-profit research organization called Ai2 based in Seattle.

Moreover, some users have reported that in their tests involving images with Japanese text, Pixtral Large's recognition capabilities were inferior to the 7B version of Qwen.

In addition to Pixtral Large, Mistral AI's most advanced text model, Mistral Large, has also received an update. This model is available via the API as `pixtral-large-latest` and on Hugging Face as `Mistral Large 24.11`.

Mistral Large 24.11 will first be rolled out on Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, with availability expected within a week.
